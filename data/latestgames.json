    "description": "The Last of Us is a post-apocalypse 3rd person adventure with a distinct focus on naturalness and photorealistic graphics. It is the first title in the IP, followed by the second part, coming out in 2019 by Naughty Dog, mostly known for 'Crash Bandicoot' and 'Uncharted' series.\r\nYou play as Joel, delivering small requests in America, the year 2033, precisely 20 years after Cordyceps fungus catastrophe which have turned human hosts into infected shrooms. Your next quest is to deliver 14 years-old Ellie, immune to the virus to the hospital in the other end of a state. It is a usual story of two characters getting along throughout their journey.\r\nYou need to fight fungus infected and usual soldiers, patrolling the territory — ammo and health are of the essence here, because it is post-apocalypse and everyone is short of resources. You face multiple encounters with bosses, various traps, and numerous puzzles. Let alone the number of collectibles telling a complete story of an epidemic world.",

Following the source material more accurately, this time Geralt is trying to find the child of the prophecy, Ciri while making a quick coin from various contracts on the side. Great attention to the world building above all creates an immersive story, where your decisions will shape the world around you.\n\nCD Project Red are infamous for the amount of work they put into their games, and it shows, because aside from classic third-person action RPG base game they provided 2 massive DLCs with unique questlines and 16 smaller DLCs, containing extra quests and items.\n\nPlayers praise the game for its atmosphere and a wide open world that finds the balance between fantasy elements and realistic and believable mechanics, and the game deserved numerous awards for every aspect of the game, from music to direction.",

    "description": "Portal 2 is a first-person puzzle game developed by Valve Corporation and released on April 19, 2011 on Steam, PS3 and Xbox 360. It was published by Valve Corporation in digital form and by Electronic Arts in physical form. \n\nIts plot directly follows the first game's, taking place in the Half-Life universe. You play as Chell, a test subject in a research facility formerly ran by the company Aperture Science, but taken over by an evil AI that turned upon its creators, GladOS. After defeating GladOS at the end of the first game but failing to escape the facility, Chell is woken up from a stasis chamber by an AI personality core, Wheatley, as the unkempt complex is falling apart. As the two attempt to navigate through the ruins and escape, they stumble upon GladOS, and accidentally re-activate her...\n\nPortal 2's core mechanics are very similar to the first game's ; the player must make their way through several test chambers which involve puzzles. For this purpose, they possess a Portal Gun, a weapon capable of creating teleportation portals on white surfaces. This seemingly simple mechanic and its subtleties coupled with the many different puzzle elements that can appear in puzzles allows the game to be easy to start playing, yet still feature profound gameplay. The sequel adds several new puzzle elements, such as gel that can render surfaces bouncy or allow you to accelerate when running on them.\n\nThe game is often praised for its gameplay, its memorable dialogue and writing and its aesthetic. Both games in the series are responsible for inspiring most puzzle games succeeding them, particularly first-person puzzle games. The series, its characters and even its items such as the portal gun and the companion cube have become a cultural icon within gaming communities.\n\nPortal 2 also features a co-op mode where two players take on the roles of robots being led through tests by GladOS, as well as an in-depth level editor.",

    "description": "It is a new beginning for Kratos. Living as a man outside the shadow of the gods, he ventures into the brutal Norse wilds with his son Atreus, fighting to fulfill a deeply personal quest. \r\n\r\nHis vengeance against the Gods of Olympus years behind him, Kratos now lives as a man in the realm of Norse Gods and monsters. It is in this harsh, unforgiving world that he must fight to survive… And teach his son to do the same. This startling reimagining of God of War deconstructs the core elements that defined the series—satisfying combat; breathtaking scale; and a powerful narrative—and fuses them anew. \r\n\r\nKratos is a father again. As mentor and protector to Atreus, a son determined to earn his respect, he is forced to deal with and control the rage that has long defined him while out in a very dangerous world with his son. \r\n\r\nFrom the marble and columns of ornate Olympus to the gritty forests, mountains, and caves of Pre-Viking Norse lore, this is a distinctly new realm with its own pantheon of creatures, monsters, and gods. With an added emphasis on discovery and exploration, the world will draw players in to explore every inch of God of War’s breathtakingly threatening landscape—by far the largest in the franchise. \r\n\r\nWith an over the shoulder free camera that brings the player closer to the action than ever before, fights in God of War mirror the pantheon of Norse creatures Kratos will face: grand, gritty, and grueling. A new main weapon and new abilities retain the defining spirit of God of War while presenting a vision of violent conflict that forges new ground in the genre",

    "description": "The population of the Earth almost disappeared as a result of a pandemic caused by a mutated fungus. The disease causes irreversible changes in the human body, a person loses his mind and behaves aggressively, like a zombie. Civilization no longer exists, few survivors live in isolation under the protection of the military.\nCities outside the zones are dangerous ruins inhabited by infected people and people who have almost lost humanity.\nHeroes, the smuggler Joel and teenage girl Ellie, are trying to cross the continent, colliding in depopulated cities with all the set of dangers. The game requires hidden actions, the combat capability and the number of ammunition of the heroes are small, and it is best for them to avoid fighting. For most of the game, the player controls Joel, while Ellie and Joel's other companions are controlled by artificial intelligence.\nThe levels of the game are very extensive, at each level the task is the same - to reach a certain point alive.\n\nCharacters have something like a shotgun pistol, bow and arrow, as well as improvised items - pipes, sticks, baseball bats.\nFrom time to time, it is necessary to solve the problem of perceptiveness.\nArtificial intelligence, which controls opponents, can behave differently depending on the situation.",

    "description": "Resident Evil 2 is the remake of the 1998 game of the same name. \n\n###Plot\nThe plot of the remake is identical to that of the original game. The story follows the survivors of a zombie virus outbreak in the fictional Raccoon City. There are two protagonists: Claire Redfield, a high school student, and Leon Kennedy, a policeman. They both search for the ways to escape the infested city. Companions, such as Ada Wong and Sherry, occasionally follow the protagonists. The characters eventually uncover the dark secrets of the Umbrella Corporation, which created the virus as a biological weapon, and fight its monsters, such as the Tyrant.\n\n###Gameplay\nThe player controls either Leon or Claire from the third person view in a 3D environment. The two protagonists' storylines are intertwined. The player can complete the scenario playing one of the protagonists, and then replay it from the other character's POV, with all his previous actions taken into account. The game combines puzzle solving with zombie fights. Both protagonists use firearms as their main weapon; however, ammo is scarce.\n\n###Changes from the original\nBesides the updated graphics, the remake features a new camera and controls. In the original game, the controls were relative to the position of the player's character rather than the camera. The remake uses an over the shoulder camera, and the movements are relative to its angle. There's also no more loading screens, and the characters move between locations seamlessly.",

    "description": "Grand Theft Auto - San Andreas is the seventh entry in the series in the GTA franchise, but only second big title after GTA - Vice City. Setting up in fictional state San Andreas, you follow the story of CJ, a member of one of the multiple gangs in the city. CJ's family is being attacked in drive shooting which resulted in the death of CJ's mother, so he returns to home from Liberty City. Meeting the rest of the family at his mom's funeral, he decides to rebuild the gang and gain control of the state.\r\n\r\nThe game makes a brilliant connection with missions and open world actions that you are able to do around the cities. You can steal cars, buy guns, hunt for collectables and do some side quests, while different characters give you specific missions in order to push the plot forward. Streets are filled with people as well as plenty of vehicles to steal. Fictional brands of cars, tanks, bikes are available to be stolen from any place around the city. Armoury contains pistols, rifles, hand-machine guns or a rocket launcher as well as melee weapons giving player freedom in anything he's doing in GTA.",

But here you will try out the FPS game filled with environmental puzzles and engaging story. \r\nSilent template for your adventures, Chell, wakes up in a testing facility. She’s a subject of experiments on instant travel device, supervised by snarky and hostile GLaDOS.\r\nPlayers will have to complete the tests, room by room, expecting either reward, freedom or more tests. By using the gun, that shoots portals (Portal-Gun™), players will move blocks, travel great distance quickly and learn about your current situation, which is unraveled through environmental storytelling. What you will be told might be different from what you will see.\r\nWhite environments will guide the player’s portal placement, forcing them to pay attention to the surroundings.  Portal creates tension, allowing either solving puzzles at your own leisure or moving quickly, due to the time limit or threats.",

    "description": "Gordon Freeman became the most popular nameless and voiceless protagonist in gaming history. He is painted as the most famous scientist and a hero within the world of Half-Life, and for a good reason. In the first game he saved the planet from alien invasion, this time, when the invasion is already begun, the world needs his help one more time. And you, as a player, will help this world to survive. This time Gordon arrives in City 17, ravaged and occupied by Combines, where he meets his old Black Mesa friends. \r\nWhat is different, aside from the overall design quality, is the use of Valve’s Source engine that not only expands on the fluidity of character model animations and movement but allows players to interact with a myriad of objects with the advanced and realistic (to an extent) physics. Classic Headcrab Zombies are revamped and have new variants that provide players with different threats. For a story-driven FPS, Half-Life 2 is unique in its plot delivery, and making in-game mechanics feel natural, be it platforming or driving.",

    "description": "Gather your party, and return to the Forgotten Realms in a tale of fellowship and betrayal, sacrifice and survival, and the lure of absolute power.\r\n\r\nMysterious abilities are awakening inside you, drawn from a Mind Flayer parasite planted in your brain. Resist, and turn darkness against itself. Or embrace corruption, and become ultimate evil.\r\n\r\nFrom the creators of Divinity: Original Sin 2 comes a next-generation RPG, set in the world of Dungeons and Dragons.\r\n\r\nChoose from a wide selection of D&D races and classes, or play as an origin character with a hand-crafted background. Adventure, loot, battle and romance as you journey through the Forgotten Realms and beyond. Play alone, and select your companions carefully, or as a party of up to four in multiplayer.\r\n\r\nAbducted, infected, lost. You are turning into a monster, but as the corruption inside you grows, so does your power. That power may help you to survive, but there will be a price to pay, and more than any ability, the bonds of trust that you build within your party could be your greatest strength. Caught in a conflict between devils, deities, and sinister otherworldly forces, you will determine the fate of the Forgotten Realms together.\r\n\r\nForged with the new Divinity 4.0 engine, Baldur’s Gate 3 gives you unprecedented freedom to explore, experiment, and interact with a world that reacts to your choices. A grand, cinematic narrative brings you closer to your characters than ever before, as you venture through our biggest world yet.\r\n\r\nThe Forgotten Realms are a vast, detailed and diverse world, and there are secrets to be discovered all around you -- verticality is a vital part of exploration. Sneak, dip, shove, climb, and jump as you journey from the depths of the Underdark to the glittering rooftops of the Upper City. How you survive, and the mark you leave on the world, is up to you.",

    "description": "Hollow Knight is a Metroidvania-type game developed by an indie studio named Team Cherry.\r\n\r\nMost of the game's story is told through the in-world items, tablets, and thoughts of other characters. Many plot aspects are told to the player indirectly or through the secret areas that provide a bit of lore in addition to an upgrade. At the beginning of the game, the player visits a town of Dirtmouth. A town built above the ruins of Hallownest. The players descend down into the ruins to find some answers to his questions.\r\n\r\nThe game revolves mainly around the exploration of the in-game world, which requires the players to have some platforming skills. The players have to find secrets that are scattered around the level and battle their enemies. There is a certain degree of backtracking in the game as some areas are locked until the player defeats a certain boss or picks up a specific item. Each area changes as the plot advances so it may be surprising to come back in a certain area. \r\n\r\nThe Protagonist uses a nail which serves as a replacement for a sword. Players can attack in four directions. The nail is upgradable.",

    "description": "Return of the classic FPS, Doom (2016) acts as a reboot of the series and brings back the Doomslayer, protagonist of the original Doom games. In order to solve the energy crisis, humanity learned to harvest the energy from Hell, and when something went wrong and a demon invasion has started, it’s up to the player to control the Doomslayer and destroy the evil.\n\nDoom is a fast-paced game that restores the concept of instant health packs and leaves the player against armies of Hell with no cover, no health regeneration, or help from anyone. After damaging monsters enough, they will start glowing, which will allow players to perform glory kills to restore some health. While exploring the levels, players will come across secrets, collectible items, or upgrade points for the weapons and armor. The single-player campaign silent protagonist has a noticeable personality. He gets visibly annoyed and angry in his actions during expository cutscenes and forces his way through the game. Multiplayer maps gather players in Deathmatch/”king-of-the-hill” type game modes, with all the weapons from the single-player campaign.",

    "description": "The third game in the series, Bioshock takes the story of the underwater confinement within the lost city of Rapture and takes it in the sky-city of Columbia. Players will follow Booker DeWitt, a private eye with a military past; as he will attempt to wipe his debts with the only skill he’s good at – finding people. Aside from obvious story and style differences, this time Bioshock protagonist has a personality, character, and voice, no longer the protagonist is a silent man, trying to survive.\r\nOpen and bright level design of Columbia shows industrial colonial America in a seemingly endless carnival. But Bioshock is not famous for its visuals, but for its story.  Mystery and creative vision of Irrational Games invite players to uncover the secrets of Columbia’s leader - Zachary Comstock and save Elizabeth, the girl, that’s been locked up in the flying city since her birth.\r\nUnique weapons and mechanics of Vigor will make encounters different, helping players to adjust to the new found mobility and hook shot, making fights fast-paced and imaginative.",

    "description": "Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots is a stealth-action third-person game developed by Kojima Productions. It is the fourth major installment in the series. It was marketed as the last game in the series. \n\n###Plot\nNine years have passed after the infamous Shadow Moses incident. The world is torn apart by local conflicts. Nations hire private military corporations instead of having their own armies. The  War Economy emerges with the Sons Of the Patriots system controlling the PMCs. Soldiers are infused with nanomachines that control their behavior on the battlefield, and the weapons are ID-locked. Liquid Ocelot sets out to hijack the system to use in his own interests. Solid Snake grows old rapidly and gets ready for his last mission in order to kill Liquid and save the world once again.\n\n###Gameplay\nSnake is proficient in Close quarters combat and stealth infiltration. Players are deployed on the battlefield with a wide arrange of gadgets at their disposal, such as the OctoCamo that allows for replicating any surface the player is close to or a Solid Eye that serves as the game's HUD. It is essential to keep an eye on Snake's stress level. As the protagonist's stress level increases, it gets harder to aim, Snake suffers more damage, and it is easier to get knocked out in hand-to-hand combat.\n\nA VR mode is also present in the game where players can learn about the weapons they can use and master the CQC.",

    "description": "Forza Horizon 3 is a racing open-world game developed by Playground Games. It is a part of a large Forza series including 11 titles in it with Horizon 3 being the 9th heading in the row. It is, however, uncertain to claim that there is a unified narrative in racing games, so all 11 titles more likely represent one universe, but do not come in specific order.\r\nAs mentioned earlier, the title series does not follow a distinct storyline. Speaking of surroundings, nonetheless, it is safe to say, that the Horizon 3's scene is an Australia. The previous chapters of racing have pushed a narrative about the players being a participator of Horizon Festival. Now the protagonist becomes a host of the event, so they must play organizing roles, too. For example, hire drivers and adjust the racing grounds.\r\nThere are some events players can be a part of.  For example, drifting competition, Bucket List challenges and time trials. All of them utilize the same mechanics of getting to the finish line as fast as possible. There are more than 350 cars available, let alone DLC ones. 4-person co-op included along with multiplatform races between PC and Xbox One.",

After surviving the plane crash, the protagonist has only one way to go – to the giant lighthouse that opens a way to the underwater utopia. Players will have to unravel the complicated history of Rapture, relying only on themselves, their guns and Plasmids, a mystical substance, that allows it’s user to obtain near magical abilities.\r\nThe atmosphere of isolation and threat is conveyed through the environmental sounds, subtle electrical buzzing and audio logs, telling the story of societal decay and despair. Players will shape the story, making moral choices along their way, saving Little Sisters or extracting ADAM, the mystical fuel for your abilities. While exploring the underwater city, players will complete missions for the last sane inhabitants of Rapture, while fending off the less fortunate ones.",

    "description": "It's a classic hit and exclusive for the PlayStation 2. Released in 2001, a minimalistic action-adventure explores a simple concept - the boy meets the girl. However, the approach of Japanese game designer Fumito Ueda made the game a real hit.\n\nThe player takes control of the young boy with horns named Ico. He was kidnapped by a group of soldiers and imprisoned in a stone sarcophagus. The kidnappers plan to sacrifice him, but Ico manages to flee. During the escape, he stumbles upon a girl named Yorda speaking a different language. She is the daughter of the castle’s Queen. The mother is going to use the body of Yorda to extend her life. So begins a long road to freedom.\n\nThe game has many innovative mechanics: for example, the story is told with the minimal use of words, it also used new graphics techniques never seen before on consoles. Despite the commercial failure, the game is recognized as a work of art and is considered must play for all fans of video games.",

    "description": "FICSIT - AN INTRODUCTION\nWelcome to FICSIT Incorporated! A company specialised in the research, development and application of new technology and science, anything to find short-term solutions to long-term problems! As part of our brand-new Save The Day program, you’ll be sent to one of many alien planets in an effort to contribute to Project Assembly, a project I am legally bound to not tell you anything about for fear of our lives. And my job.\nAs an engineer and pioneer, you won’t only be constructing and automating the very factory that will contribute to Project Assembly, but also explore and exploit the planet and its inhabitants as you expand. Don’t worry, we’re super inclusive when it comes to alien lifeforms! We’ll even allow for pets, how cool is that!?\nJust don’t tell R&D.\nBelow you can find the three main pillars of your mission! Time to get to work, and Stay Effective!*\n*This motto is FICSIT Inc. property. Please do not use ironically.\nCONSTRUCT\nTo achieve company milestones according to satisfaction we expect you to construct your FICSIT Inc. factory in such a way that it allows for easy expansion and complexion. Not only will buildings grow more complex over time, so will the parts they produce. Project Assembly isn’t your average high-school science project. We’re making history here! Go big or go home!* Of course, this requires both high-level and low-level power management, good luck getting to nuclear! We even support stuff like multi-floor warehouses so you can stack your buildings, and a whole bunch of navigational constructs like jump pads and walkways! Walkways are the best. They’re attached to the ground and everything.\n*Employee will be expected to fund their own travel expenses\nAUTOMATE\nSo you know how your FICSIT Inc. factory can be turned into this incredibly intricate maze of conveyor belts in every direction, merging, splitting, crossing each other above and below? Conveyor belts carry, after all, the life-blood of our company! Well, since you’ll be in a pretty big area you’re going to need outposts. To make your life easier, we’ve developed self-driving trucks and trains so you can set up your very own transport system between any point in your area!\nEXPLORE & EXPLOIT\nR&D hasn’t figured out how to clone materials yet, weirdly enough, so you’re going to have to go out and use our patented method of extraterrestrial pioneering! This means exploring to find more or new stuff to exploit, to help expand your FICSIT Inc. factory. You’re on an uncharted alien planet, so try to be careful, don’t go alone if you don’t have to, and use protection! Who knows what kind of organisms have made this place their home? Or who knows what awesome treasures you’ll find? Don’t worry, this is why we assigned you your very own FICSIT Inc. handler.",

    "description": "Prey (2017) is a single-player sci-fi first-person shooter developed by Arkane Studios Austin and published by Bethesda Softworks. While it is technically a reboot of the 2006 game of the same name developed by Human Head Studios, of which the sequel suffered a fall into development hell before the license was sold to Bethesda Softworks, there is no relation between the stories and universes of the two games.\r\n\r\nThe game is set in the near future of an alternate reality. You find yourself stranded on the Talos I space station, invaded by hostile aliens referred to as the Typhon. To survive, you must explore Talos I in search of weapons and resources to fight off the invaders. Along the way, you'll use neural modification devices to learn skills and psychic abilites.\r\n\r\nPrey's gameplay loop takes heavy inspiration from System Shock and Bioshock. The game received critical acclaim for its gameplay and its atmosphere. Prey received one paid DLC extension called Mooncrash which introduced a roguelite mode and a free update called Typhon Hunter which introduced a multiplayer mode inspired by classic prop hunt.",

    "description": "Horizon Zero Dawn is an experiment. A very impressive experiment that actually succeeded. \r\nHaving a very curious mix of cyberpunk and prehistorical styles and esthetic, the game provides us with quite a unique experience. We need to arm ourselves with arrows and a bow, with a spear or any other prehistorical-ish weapon in order to defeat out enemies - dinosaur-mechanisms that are spread around the world. If that wasn't enough, Aloy our main protagonist can control an AI named GAIA. What we're having here is an exciting connection with \"very old times\" and \"near future\", even though the game is set up in the 31st century. \r\nBeing an outcast with her father Rost, Aloy must restore her position in the tribe and save the world by stopping the Eclipse, a cult that wants to rule the world. Join her on that journey, exploring the world and people that live in such hard surroundings.",

    "description": "Hope's Peak Academy is home to Japan's best and brightest high school students—the beacons of hope for the future. But that hope suddenly dies when Makoto Naegi and his classmates find themselves imprisoned in the school, cut off from the outside world and subject to the whims of a strange, murderous little bear named Monokuma. He pits the students against each other, promising freedom to anyone who can murder a fellow classmate and get away with it.\nIt's up to you to find out who Monokuma really is, and why you've been taken from the world you once knew. But be careful what you wish for—sometimes there’s nothing more deadly than the truth...\nKey Features\nDaily Life, Deadly Life: Trapped in a school-turned-prison, students are murdering each other one by one. You’ll have to investigate each incident, search for clues, and talk to your classmates to try and get to the bottom of each brutal case!\nMock Trial: The nefarious Monokuma serves as judge, jury, and executioner as you engage in deadly wordplay, going back and forth with suspects, dissecting their statements and firing their words back at them to expose their lies!\nPopularity Contest: Sway classmates to your side in each investigation, squeezing information from them to figure out who did it. And when you do, turn up the heat in a variety of timing and reflex-based game systems to uncover the truth and save your skin!\nSteam Features: Supports Steam Achievements, Steam Cloud and Steam Trading Cards.",

    "description": "Demon’s Souls is an action RPG, the first installment in the Souls series, known mostly because of the Dark Souls trilogy. Demon’s Souls is also set in a grey-colored dark medieval-themed world that is attacked by the demon fog. You take on the role of a knight that entered the fog trying to save the kingdom from demons. He was eventually killed and reborn, and now needs to travel the entire kingdom to gain power and set the world free.\n\nYour character is fully customizable and can be upgraded with souls you get through battles. Demon’s Souls combat system is quite complicated as you can’t gain experience killing ordinary enemies to defeat the boss later. Here you need to work out unique tactics for every monster type. As a result, the gameplay is quite challenging with frequent deaths.\n\nHowever, there’s a way to simplify the game a little. Some of your actions, for example, killing or helping NPCs, affect the gameplay. This parameter is called tendency; when it’s white, the enemies are easier and the rewards are fewer. When it’s black, it produces the opposite effect.",

    "description": "Final Fantasy VIII is a Japanese role-playing game, the eight main installments in Final Fantasy series.  \n\n###Plot and setting \nLike most other Final Fantasy entries, the game takes place in an entirely new world that is not connected with previous games in the series. It can be described as the mix of modern Europe and futuristic setting with high fantasy influences. The game follows six main heroes, five of which are members of the elite military organization called SeeD, on their quest to defeat Ultimecia, an evil sorceress who wishes to compress time. Like its predecessor, Final Fantasy VII, the game heavily focuses on its story, characters and game world exposure.  \n\n###Gameplay \nThe gameplay of Final Fantasy VIII shares many similarities with other JRPGs of that era. The player can explore the overworld, visit different locations such as town, settlements, forests, interact with NPCs and fight numerous types of monsters in turn-based battles.\nWhile the world exploration aspect, for the most part, is similar to that of the previous game, the battle system has several notable differences. The combat in the game is centered on Junction system that allows the player to junction summoned monsters known as Guardian Forces to platy members. That gives characters the ability to use various magic, alter their stats and draw spells from enemies during the battles. Because of the system’s flexibility regarding character customization, the game is absent of job system typical for the series.",

The player will become Niko Bellic, immigrant arriving at the Liberty City to reunite with his cousin Roman and find the man that betrayed him and his army unit fifteen years prior to the events of the game. While protecting his cousin, Niko has to deal with loan sharks, Russian mobsters, and other gangs. After the third game, GTA brought more realism to the player, in order to make the city and its people look more believable. Street vendors on every corner will sell food that replenishes health, bars with playable dart boards, bowling alleys and even comedy clubs and movie theatres. Open world will allow players not only hang out with important NPC in order to receive bonuses and unlocks but taking girls on the dates as well, to help Niko settle.

    "description": "Night in the Woods is a quest game developed by Infinite Fall.\n\n###Plot\nNight in the Woods takes place in a universe of anthropomorphic animals. A cat named May returns back to her hometown of Possum Springs because of a dissociative disorder that does not let her recognize other people something other than rectangular shapes. May had dropped out of college and she does not know what to do with her life yet. She got back into the town to hang out with her old friends or simply walk around the town and meet the people she knew in her childhood, yet this childhood world is no more. The city's residents start talking about something happening in the nearby forest. May gets her friends together and goes out to figure out what's going on.\n\nThe game explores the typical teenage problems in a common environment, as stated by the game's developers.\n\n###Gameplay\nThe main objective of the game is to explore the in-game world. May can run, jump, and interact with both other characters and the in-game objects. As stated by the developers, the key actions the player should take are to explore, converse, see and touch. The game focuses mostly on its narrative, rather on the gameplay experience. \n\nWhile talking to other characters, the players can choose the line for May to reply with. Your replies will affect the game's story, yet the change will be minor.",

    "description": "The first part of the famous casual game about plants and zombies from the studio PopCap. The player will act as a homeowner, who uses different types of plants to protect his house from the invasion of zombies.\n\nIn the game, there are several types of plants and mushrooms that have a unique defense or attacking characteristics. The playing field is divided into 5 or 6 horizontal lines, along which the undead moves. To plant a plant, you need to spend a local analog of gold \"suns.\" Most plants can attack enemies only on their own line, however, as they pass and purchase upgrades, you can attack and enemies on several lines.\n\nThe game has three modes: singleplayer, multiplayer and Adventure Mode, in which players can earn currency for upgrades. As you go through, additional modes open: for example, Survival Mode and Puzzle Mode with mini-games.",

    "description": "The horns sound, the ravens gather. An empire is torn by civil war. Beyond its borders, new kingdoms rise. Gird on your sword, don your armour, summon your followers and ride forth to win glory on the battlefields of Calradia. Establish your hegemony and create a new world out of the ashes of the old.\nMount & Blade II: Bannerlord is the eagerly awaited sequel to the acclaimed medieval combat simulator and role-playing game Mount & Blade: Warband. Set 200 years before, it expands both the detailed fighting system and the world of Calradia. Bombard mountain fastnesses with siege engines, establish secret criminal empires in the back alleys of cities, or charge into the thick of chaotic battles in your quest for power.\nSIEGE GAMEPLAY\nConstruct, position and fire a range of heavy machinery in sieges that will test your wits and skill like never before. Experience epic, sprawling combat across ramparts and rubble as you desperately hold on to your castle or seek to seize one from the enemy.\nHistorically authentic defensive structures offer the ultimate medieval warfare experience, as you batter a rival's gate with your ram or burn his siege tower to ashes. Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord lets you live every moment of a chaotic battle through the eyes of a single soldier.\nDIPLOMACY\nEngage in diplomacy, with meaningful consequences that impact the world. Strike historic peace deals that win land for your kingdom or free you to take on a new foe. An all-new barter system gives players flexibility in cementing deals, from marriage offers to treason pacts, offering all the options available to NPCs. Use a new influence system to direct your faction's energies or strangle the aspirations of a rival.\nSANDBOX ECONOMY\nSee the availability of goods ebb and flow in a simulated feudal economy, where the price of everything from incense to warhorses fluctuates with supply and demand. Invest in farms and workshops, or turn anarchy to your advantage by being the first to bring grain to a starving town after a siege or reopening a bandit-plagued caravan route.\nCRAFTING\nCraft your own weapon, name it and carry it with you to the field of battle! A deep, physics-based system gives each weapon you create a unique set of attributes, strengths and weaknesses. Forge a finely-tuned killing machine to match your own prowess and complement your play-style, or take the sword of your enemy and brandish it as a trophy of war.\nMODDING\nThe engine and tools used to develop Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord are being made available to the community, so that modders can re-interpret Calradia or create their own worlds! Players can now combine different mods, making it easier than ever to play the game of your dreams.\nENGINE\nAn all-new tailor-made game engine, developed in-house to fulfill the unique needs of the series, offers the perfect balance of performance and graphical fidelity, scalable with the power of your hardware.\nExperience Mount & Blade with richer, more beautiful graphics than ever, immersing you in the world of Calradia, rendering the game's magnificent battles with equally spectacular detail.",

    "description": "Batman: Arkham Knight is the final instalment for the Arkham series by now. Joining forces with Bruce Wayne for the last time, we have to oppose Scarecrow and other iconic villains such as The Riddler, Harleen Quinzel a.k.a. Harley Quinn, Penguin and others.\n\nThe story continued after events in Arkham City when Joker died due to infection in his blood. Now, Scarecrow tries to release a new fear toxin, meanwhile new mysterious Arkham Knight plots against Batman as well. Still having consequences after being poisoned by the Joker and seeing visions with him, Bruce has to prevail the death of Gotham City.\n\nThe gameplay mechanics stays the same to the Arkham series. Melee combat system, use of the detective skills to find clues and gadgets still play a major role in Batman's fight against evil. Although now you can travel around not only by your grappling hook but a legendary Batmobile as well. Iconic voices of the characters, Kevin Conroy and Mark Hammil once again return to give their voices for the last game in Arkham series.",

Follow a trail of cryptic letters and solve many unique devices in ever more extraordinary places, on a time-spanning journey where machinery meets myth.\nThe Room PC is a fully-enhanced HD release of Apple's 2012 iPad Game Of The Year, including the 'EPILOGUE' DLC that adds 20% more content and play time to the original release. This PC version of the game has been many months in the making and has involved recreating almost every asset in the game from the ground up.\nFireproof Games are a small independent team working in Guildford in the UK. We self-published our first game The Room in September 2012 and were stunned with both the critical success and our new-found fan-base, not to mention multiple international awards. The Room has changed our lives and we hope you enjoy playing it as much as we enjoyed making it.",

    "description": "FINAL FANTASY XIV: A Realm Reborn is a massively multiplayer RPG developed by Square Enix. It is the direct continuation of FINAL FANTASY XIV.\n\nFFXIV: A Realm Reborn is a heavily updated version of the original FINAL FANTASY XIV with a different graphics engine, netcode, and storyline. The game was made because the game sold poorly and wasn't met with critical acclaim.\n\n###Plot\nThe game takes place in  Eorzea five years after the events of the original game. FINAL FANTASY XIV ended on an apocalyptic note - a dragon god destroyed most of the Eorzea. Thanks to the blessing of the Gods, the player-created characters were able to escape certain death and were sent five years to the future. In a rebuilt world they face the danger of invasion by the Empire of the north.\n\n###Gameplay\nIn FFXIV, the players interact with each other in a world that continues to live on even without any players on the server. At the beginning of the game, the players are met by a character creation screen where they choose the name, race, gender, build, appearance and the base class. It is also necessary to choose a game world for your character. \n\nPlayers level up their characters by gaining EXP. EXP is gained by raiding dungeons, taking part in server-wide events, killing monsters, and completing quests.\n\nThe game's combat system revolves around using a combination of character-specific weapon skills, the use of magic, and the physical attacks themselves.",

    "description": "Cyberpunk 2077 is a science fiction game loosely based on the role-playing game Cyberpunk 2020.\r\n\r\n###Setting\r\nThe game is set in the year 2077 in a fictional futuristic metropolis Night City in California. In the world of the game, there are developed cybernetic augmentations that enhance people's strength, agility, and memory. The city is governed by corporations. Many jobs are taken over by the robots, leaving a lot of people poor and homeless. Night City has a roaring underworld, with black markets, underground surgeons, drug dealers, and street gangs abound.\r\n\r\n###Characters\r\nThe main protagonist is fully customizable, including his or her sex and appearance, and goes by the nickname V. He or she is an underground mercenary who does “dirty business” for the various contractors. An NPC companion named Jackie joins the protagonist early at the game, and various other companions may join the player on certain missions as the plot demands. However, the game has no parties and no companion system.\r\n\r\n###Gameplay\r\nThe player controls V from the first person view, with the third-person view used for cutscenes only. The protagonist can travel across the city on feet or using various vehicles, in a manner some observers compared to GTA series. There are many options for the character customization, including three character classes, and a variety of augmentations V can install to enhance his or her abilities.",

    "description": "Middle of the trilogy, Banner Saga 2 keeps the core of a tactical fantasy game with RPG elements. Banner Saga 2 is covering up the chapters 8 through 15 and picking up the story from the ending of the first game. The caravan was fleeing to the Walls of Arberrang, in order to escape the Dredge. The central character of the second game depends on who lost the Silver Arrow, Rook or Alette. Players will be able to see the perspective of Bolverk is some chapters.\n\nSince the game is developed by only three people, it is much easier to gather feedback by the team directly, they were able to listen to the criticisms and complaints from players about prolonged battles and lack of variety, so Banner Saga introduces new units, new talents, and new enemies. Any choices made in the first game have an impact on the events of later chapters. An entirely new race resembling centaurs, called The Horseborn.",

    "description": "Pyre is an action-adventure game developed by Supergiant games. \n\n###Setting\nThe game is set in some purgatory. After getting banished by the society, the main character finds himself all alone. Three exiles soon approach him and invite the protagonist to party with them and nickname him the Reader. The group sets out to cleanse their souls.\n\n###Gameplay\nThe gameplay of Pyre revolves around some sports game, which is connected with a ritual known as the Rites, which happens in a parallel world. The Protagonist controls his three newly found friends in battles against three opponents on a small arena. Each team has its own pyre. Both pyres oppose each other. The objective of the game is to defend your pyre while attacking the enemy one. The player can only destroy the pyre with the orb, that is spawned in the center of the arena and which has to be grabbed and thrown into the pyre.\n\nDuring a round, the Reader can switch between the character he wants to control and pass the orb from one to another. Each player has their own amount of endurance which is required for moving around the arena. If the players of a team come together, they create a zone that is dangerous for the player that carries the orb. If the player with the orb should get into that zone, they'll be temporarily removed from the game.\n\nWhile free from the Rites, the player can travel through the world of Pyre, train his teammates or try to learn more about the Rites.",

Snake seeks revenge for the attack on the MSF group 9 years ago, that placed Big Boss into a coma. After the failed assassination attempt, Big Boss takes the code name Venom Snake, delving back into the world of superhumans and espionage.\r\nA large-scale story that includes 5 hours of cinematic cutscenes compliments open world exploration with hundreds of audio logs and side missions, forming the atmosphere of military drama with sci-fi elements. MGS5: Phantom Pain has an advanced AI system that will allow enemy soldiers constantly call for reinforcements if they see that something is wrong, forcing players to take down communications and fight or retreat and try again. \r\nPlayers will manage the base by gathering and managing staff, weaponry, and resources, in order to upgrade their personal arsenal and companions.",

    "description": "The player is Geralt of Rivia, infamous monster slayer. In the second game of the series, titular witcher is involved in the inner conflicts of Temeria, where he stopped the rebellion and was hired as a bodyguard of Temerian King Foltest. Eventually, Foltest was assassinated by a witcher-like assassin, and the only person fitting the description was Geralt. \r\nThe game combat system was reworked, in order to add traps and ranged throwing weapon, giving players more control over the course of the battle. It’s still a third person action RPG, and the player can upgrade and improve general abilities, swordsmanship, alchemy, and magic. \r\nThe enhanced edition includes additional hours of content, new cinematics, the original soundtrack, game manual and quest handbook, among other things. The new tutorial allows players to spend more time to master new game mechanics and see for themselves visual improvements to the core game.",

    "description": "Skate 3 is a skateboarding simulator developed by EA Black Box. It is the third game in the series and is a direct sequel to Skate 2.\n\n###Plot\nThe game takes place sometime later after the events of Skate 2. The main protagonist, who is now known as The Legend, became one of the best skaters. He travels to a coastal town of Port Carventer to take part in a sponsored event but fails. To get to the top again, he has to put up his own team.\n\n###Gameplay\nPort Carventer differs a lot from San Vanselona. There are no zones where skating is restricted. The city itself consists of three zones: The City, The University, and the Industrial Area. Each zone has its own differences, for example, there are a lot of monuments and concrete buildings in The City, while The University boasts a high number of open spaces.\n\nLike in previous installments, the game's core mechanic called Flick It is still present in the game and is essential for getting high scores. It gives the player control of the skater and maps it to the right stick of the gamepad. Players are given points for doing tricks. The amount of points depends on the difficulty of the trick and their combos. \n\nThe game offers three difficulty settings: Easy (you can jump higher and do tricks faster), Normal (a classic difficulty, like in previous games of the series), and Hardcore (the physics resembles the same of the real world). \n\nThere is an in-depth tutorial called Skate.school that is accessible at any point in the game.",

    "description": "Lost, alone and separated from family, a stray cat must untangle an ancient mystery to escape a long-forgotten city.\n\nStray is a third-person cat adventure game set amidst the detailed, neon-lit alleys of a decaying cybercity and the murky environments of its seedy underbelly. Roam surroundings high and low, defend against unforeseen threats and solve the mysteries of this unwelcoming place inhabited by curious droids and dangerous creatures.\n\nSee the world through the eyes of a cat and interact with the environment in playful ways. Be stealthy, nimble, silly, and sometimes as annoying as possible with the strange inhabitants of this mysterious world.\n\nAlong the way, the cat befriends a small flying drone, known only as B-12. With the help of this newfound companion, the duo must find a way out.\n\nStray is developed by BlueTwelve Studio, a small team from the south of France mostly made up of cats and a handful of humans.",

    "description": "This popular 2D puzzle-platformer creates the atmosphere of isolation, where the player alone can guide the nameless protagonist to his destination. Hostile environments and one-hit deaths may seem difficult, but the game implements a fair amount of checkpoints. The monochrome color palette showcases cartoony proportions of every living thing while making lack of details threatening. Limbo shows you exactly what you encounter, but never how it looks.\n\nLimbo uses the atmosphere and sound design of the horror genre while avoiding tropes of the modern horror games. The overarching theme and unique style compensated for the rather short game with an abrupt ending, making Limbo one of the most impactful games for the genre.\n\nThe simple controls and easy-to-pick-up mechanics help to make a clear distinction, which part of the stage players can interact with, and which part can lead to the quick death. Even though the game is in black and white, this separation is intuitive and natural, so the player would know exactly where to go or what to do.",

    "description": "Interactive storytelling and plot-heavy games gained popularity, and “Life is Strange” arrived as teen mystery adventure. The plot will go through the life of Maxine, a teenager in possession of curious power, allowing her to stop and rewind time, in order to manipulate her surroundings. Max, after the reunion with her friend Chloe, is on the path to uncovering the secrets of Arcadia Bay. Players will have to deal with puzzle solving through the fetch quests, in order to change the world around them. \nThe game puts players in situations, where they’re forced to make a moral choice, going through the decision which may have short-term or long-term consequences. Every choice made by the player will trigger the butterfly effect, surrounding the first playthrough of the game with a lot of emotional struggle, thoughtfully crafted by the developers at Dontnod Entertainment. Life is Strange is third person adventure game, where players might seem just as an observer of the stories, unfolding in front of them.",

    "description": "Mini Metro is an indie puzzle strategy game about building a rail transit network. You have to provide transport in continually growing cities by building stations, railways and disposing of trains. The number of passengers continually increases, and once any of the stations reaches its capacity limit, the game is over. With each in-game week, you get new trains and upgrades that allow you to upgrade stations capacity or give you additional tunnels, rail lines or train carriages.  \nEvery level in Mini Metro is based on the real city. Some of them have their unique features like high-speed Shinkansen trains in the Tokyo level. The game is notable for its minimalistic art-style. Almost every element on the level is made of simple shapes and bold colors. The different shapes represent different stations and passenger’s destinations. This style was chosen so it can imitate the real-life railway mar schemes.",

New survivors are making their way through 5 campaigns with an added ability to play through the story of the first game as well, using not only expanded arsenal of 20 ranged and 10 melee weapons but improved AI Director. Your surroundings and weather will change; enemy and item placement will differ from map to map, from difficulty to difficulty. New unique special zombies, placed in the unlucky for the player spot, can end your run.\r\nHigh compatibility with community mods will allow you not only to add user-created maps but player models, enemy models, and even in-game music, which will help any player to create the unique experience on top of solid game mechanics.\r\nCompetitive multiplayer mods from arena survival to a head-on competition with another team of survivors are addictive and, in addition to the campaign, will provide you with hundreds of hours of game content.",

    "description": "LPB is a pseudo-3d puzzler-platformer exclusive for consoles from Sony Computer Entertainment. It was developed by British Media Molecule studio who before LPB developed only one semi-experimental game Ragdoll Kung-Fu. The game tells a story about the adventures of Sackboy, but there is no actual plot to follow in the game. The main focus is on the gameplay.\n\nThe game bets on user-generated-content and invites everyone to add something of their own to it. Each new level is a new story, and the ability to create your own levels with the built-in editor greatly increases the time spent playing. You can go through the game alone or with your friends: on one console or using online services.\n\nIn addition to the level editor, players can customize the Sackboy to their taste. In the creation of costumes for the main character of the game participated other developers: for example, Supermassive Games, Fireproof Games, Tarsier Studios.",

    "description": "Burnout Paradise is a race in the open world from the studio Criterion Games.\n\nThe action takes place in a fictional Paradise City, a completely open world in which a player can participate in several kinds of races, discover new cars and secrets. \n\nA distinctive feature of the Burnout game series is the detail recreation of damage to the cars. Each accident occurs in slow-mo, and the camera hangs in the most exciting angles. In Paradise there are two types of damage: if all wheels are in place and the suspension is not damaged, then the player can continue the race despite the damage. If the player loses one of the wheels - a car is considered wrecked and player respawns. Also, all cars react realistically to all collisions: scratches and dents appear on the body, the body twists abreast solid objects impacts.\n\nPlayers can both go through the game alone in a single campaign, and compete in multiplayer races. It adds new modes such as Cops and Robbers.",

    "description": "Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver is a third-person action-adventure title developed by Crystal Dynamics. It is the direct continuation of Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain and is the second title in the series.\n\n###Plot\nThe game takes place 1500 years after the events of Blood Omen. It tells the story of Raziel, a lieutenant vampire in the Kain's army. Kain almost kills Raziel and throws him down the Lake of the Dead. However, an elder god saves Raziel from death and turns him into a Soul Stealer to help him take revenge on Kain. \n\n###Gameplay\nThe game is completely different from its predecessor. The game is played from the third person with the player being able to move it by themselves.\n\nThe gameplay is based on the ability to travel between the material and spirit worlds. This allows the player to continue on the game's plot. The item interaction in the spirit world is limited, yet it also benefits Raziel as he can pass the gates that he is unable to go through in the material world. Many of the game's puzzles are based on the differences between these two worlds. The puzzle environment of the material world can be completely different in the spirit one.\n\nThe game's combat system is based on the hack and slash principle and consists out of multiple attacks and finishing moves. The enemies of Raziel are divided into three groups: humans, spirit beings, and vampires. The main feature of the combat system is the usage of the in-world items as your own weapons.",

    "description": "Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus is a spin-off installment of the Oddworld game series. It is a direct sequel to the Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee.\n\n###Setting\nThe game is set in the Oddworld, a planet in another dimension, ten times larger than our Earth. Among its inhabitants, there's the race of Mudokons, a species of spiritual humanoids who can control others' minds. Many Mudokons serve as the slaves to their more technically advanced enemies, Glukons. The protagonist is Abe, a blue-skinned Mudokon who escaped slavery and freed many of his compatriots.\n\n###Plot\nThe game begins right after the ending of Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee. Abe learns that the evil Glukons use Mudokons as slaves in the Necrum Mines. The protagonist sets off on a quest to liberate the slaves. There, he discovers that Glukons' popular drink called Soulstorm Brew is brewed from the bones and tears of the enslaved Mudokons. Abe's goal is to destroy the Soulstorm Brewery and to set his people free. The ending depends on the number of Mudokons the player saved.\n\n###Gameplay\nOddworld combines platforming with puzzles. Its levels consist of sections that occupy one screen each and require the player to overcome puzzles to move on. Abe cannot fight his enemies, but he can use his spiritual powers to defeat them, save Mudokons and advance through the levels. Abe's abilities include mind control, interacting with fellow Mudokons and limited telekinesis. To save Mudokons, Abe has to comfort them if they're angry or depressed. If he doesn't, they can harm others or themselves.",

    "description": "Wolfenstein 3D is a first-person shooter developed by id Software. It is the third installment of the Wolfenstein game series and is one of the first FPS titles to be ever released.\n\n###Plot\nThe game is set during World War II. An American spy of Jewish descend, William Blaskowicz is captured by the SS while searching for intel on Operation: Eisenfaust. Blasko is held captive in the Wolfenstein castle which he later escapes, foils the Nazi plan and kills Adolf Hitler.\n\n###Gameplay\nWolfenstein 3D consists of three episodes, each of which are divided into 10 levels. Every level is some kind of labyrinth built up from rooms and open spaces that are divided by walls and doors. Moreover, on every level, there are secret rooms, that hold specific bonus items. At the end of each level, the players fight with a boss - a unique and buffed up enemy.\n\nThe game's art style is heavily inspired by the German bunkers of that era. Wolfenstein 3D is one of the first games to use 2.5-dimensional graphics to immerse the players.\n\nThe players are opposed by the SS soldiers, mutants, and guard dogs, which will attack the player only if they get in their line of sight. Several types of enemies can also react to the sounds of gunfire. It is possible to use stealth.\n\nOn their way, the players can find ammunition and weaponry, which are either placed on the floor or are taken away from the enemy corpses. The game features 4 weapons: a knife, a pistol, an MP40 SMG and a multi-barrel MG.",

    "description": "Terraria is a 2D action adventure sandbox game, where players create a character and gather resources in order to gradually craft stronger weapons and armor. Players create randomly generated maps that contain different locations within it, and by gathering specific resources and triggering special events, players will fight one of the many in-game bosses. Created characters can be played on different maps.\r\nThe game introduces hundreds of unique items that can be found across the entirety of the map, some of which may not even be encountered. \r\nTerraria have many different Biomes and areas with distinct visuals, containing resources and enemies unique to this biome. After gathering materials, players can craft furniture, and build settlements and houses, since after completing events or finding specific items NPCs will start to arrive, and will require player’s protection. Terraria can be played on three difficulties and has a large modding community.",

    "description": "A cinematic revival of the series in its action third person form, Tomb Rider follows Lara in her least experience period of life – her youth. Heavily influenced by Naughty Dog’s “Uncharted”, the game is a mix of everything, from stealth and survival to combat and QTE action scenes.\r\nYoung Lara Croft arrives on the Yamatai, lost island near Japan, as the leader of the expedition in search of the Yamatai Kingdom, with a diverse team of specialists. But shipwreck postponed the successful arrival and seemingly forgotten island is heavily populated with hostile inhabitants, cultists of Solarii Brotherhood.\r\nThe game will be graphic at times, especially after failed QTE’s during some of the survival scenes, but overall players will enjoy classic action adventure, reminiscent of the beginning of the series. This game is not a direct sequel or continuation of existing sub-series within the franchise, but a reboot, setting up Tomb Raider to represent modern gaming experience.\r\nThe game has RPG elements and has a world, which you can explore during the story campaign and after the completion. As well as multiplayer mode, where 2 teams (4 scavengers and 4 survivors) are clashing in 3 game modes while using weapons and environments from the single-player campaign.",

    "description": "The Witcher is the very first instalment of the series that follows the story of Geralt from Rivia. Being found unconscious on the battlefield he must retrieve his memory and help the emperor's daughter, Adda to stop her from turning in to a feral monster. Facing the biggest enemy, Salamander, Geralt must also help all the fractions around the world to find peace between each other.\n\nThe fighting system is very flexible. Choosing from three different styles, you can adapt Geralt for any kind of a combat situation. Fast style of fighting gives you an opportunity to strike your opponents with your speed. The strong style focuses itself on destroying your enemies with powerful attacks, while sweeping style is very good when facing a number of foes. You can also craft some potions to gain important benefits such as seeing in the dark or having a larger amount HP. Plot style is unique as well. The game never gives a precise definition of evil, which leads the player to convenient situations where the choice is quite bad anyway. Enhanced edition improves every aspect of the game as graphics and the productivity of it, while Director's Cut does the same without censorship for North America's version.",

    "description": "Total War Warhammer is a combination of two franchises, which brings fantasy violence of Warhammer into the combat mechanics of historical Total War series. The turn-based strategy with real-time tactical battles between clashing armies. The story campaign begins with the newly elected Emperor attempting to reunite the shattered kingdom and bring peace under his control.\nOn the release date, Total War Warhammer offered four playable factions at launch, including Empire, Greenskins, Dwarves and Vampire Courts, but eventually, Chaos and Bretonnians were added as DLC. In total, there’s 13 DLC, some of which are free. Unlike other Total War titles, Warhammer includes the ability of special faction agents to participate in battles in order to give your army an advantage, a wider variety of animations and flying units such as dragons. Addition of magic with unique spells for each faction, which sets Total War Warhammer as a different title from any other Total War game.",

    "description": "Rise of the Tomb Raider is the eleventh entry in the franchise, being a sequel to its predecessor, Tomb Raider, a reboot of the franchise. This story follows Lara Croft, one year after battling her supernatural experiences in Yamatai. This time she is trying to find the legendary city of Kitezh in Siberia, Russia. The legend behind the city begins in the 12th century and still comes nowadays, that this ancient city grants with a promise of immortality. While Lara tries to solve the mystery of Siberia, she encounters an organisation called Trinity. They want to retrieve this gift to themselves. Following the notes of her father, Lara tries to discover the secrets of the ancient city and stop Trinity in doing so.\r\n\r\nExploring the Soviet motive, even more, the game has the DLC's - Baba Yaga, the Temple of the Witch, which follows Lara in the Soviet mine and confronting the legendary witch of Russian folk-tales, Cold Darkness Awakened, the story about a secret biological weapon and Blood Ties and Lara's Nightmare - a fight for ownership of the Croft estate. \r\n\r\nBesides craftmanship and exploring, the game focuses on a very progressive combat system giving a player a wide variety of strategic options. There is a way to evade your opponents in the bushes; stealth kills with bow and arrows or open combat with firearms like shotguns, pistols and other guns. WIth earning experience, you can give Lara new ways of encountering her enemies by three different specialisations - Hunter, Survivor or Brawler. Each skill tree offers various options of combat, for example using Lara's surroundings and fauna, traps or better aim. With these options, you can choose how to guide Lara Croft in her adventures.",

    "description": "Nuclear Throne is a top-down roguelike shooter, set in a post-apocalyptic universe.\n\n###Plot and features\nThe game has a sole objective: to reach the famed Nuclear Throne. The player controls one of the many mutated characters. Each playable character is unlockable through levels, and has unique abilities, allowing for different approaches in every playthrough. Each level follows the same pattern: kill enemies, collect upgrades, kill a boss. However, there are many possibilities for a skilled player, as there are achievements to complete, and daily and weekly missions, which can have different objectives.\n\n ###Gameplay\nDying resets the game’s progress, while success opens up new mutations, weapons, and enemy types. There are five ammunition types, and many weapons share the ammo, so player often has to choose wisely. Mutations can be achieved through leveling up, with some available only to certain mutants, while others are free to choose from. Said mutations can emphasize on character’s unique skill, his weapon proficiency, or upgrade his stats.\n\n###Graphics and soundtrack\nThe game’s pixel art design is made very distinct and unique, as the setting of a post-nuclear western can lead to great possibilities for artists. Each texture, albeit simple, is recognizable and well-made, and the stylistics further emphasize the work of game’s designers. The soundtrack is a mix-match of 8-bit samples and Wild West themes, resulting in a very immersive and entertaining playthrough.",

    "description": "The Sims 3 is the third part of its series. Like all Sims game, it allows the player to control the life of a person or even a whole family.\n\n###Character creation\nBefore the main game starts, the player has to create his or her character, called sim. The player can choose to play as a single character or a family. The game allows full customization for each sim. The player chooses their gender, age, race, and body type, as well as their traits that influence the sim's in-game behavior. The traits help sims to learn new skills that will be useful in their job and social life. The player can also choose to set all settings to random. There are also settings that define if the sims will age, and how fast.\n\n###Gameplay\nThe game introduces the open world that lives on its own even when the player doesn't interfere. Unlike in Sims 2, the world is seamless and there's no long load time when you travel it. The sims themselves became more independent and require less player attention to stay alive. Sims 3 is less oriented towards \"tamagotchi\"-like life-sustaining and more towards actually living the sims' lives, such as going to work, attending parties, making friends and flirting. The sims will occasionally have wishes, and fulfilling them earns the character more happiness points.\n\n###Building homes\nThe building mode didn't change much since Sims 2, but the game introduced a few additional options. Most notably, elements don't have to be aligned to a grid anymore. The player can place them diagonally at any angle.",

    "description": "###The experiment\nExperimental side-scrolling fighting game for two players developed and published by the Messhof studio. Players compete in fencing in the pixelated game world. Despite the simplicity of the concept and of the controls, the game is very competitive, and many media called the game one of the best multiplayer experience of 2014. The name is consonant with serpent from the Norse mythology Níðhöggr, the snake appears in the game, eating the winner of the duel. The game draws inspiration from the game, which was released in 1984 - Great Swordsman, and for development used software GameMaker: Studio, which is available on Steam. Who wouldn’t want to create a game where you impale a friend, eh? \n\n###Key features\nPlayers get control over two game models that differ only in color. Controls are standard: jump, move, slide and throw the sword at your opponent. You can attack at three different heights: high, medium and low. Hit the opponent's sword to disarm the latter, and he will have to raise the sword again. The main task is to reach the end of the enemy territory. The first player who accomplished this wins. There are four different levels available for solo, local and online multiplayer. Later, the developers added new modes, like a tournament and the ability to use weapons differently.",

    "description": "Sequel to the 4-player cooperative FPS RPG Borderlands, where the new team of Vault Hunters arrives on the infamous planet Pandora in order to get the riches, hidden inside the Vault, and help to free the planet from the Handsome Jack, President of Hyperion. Clear out the endless waves and groups and marauders with various weapon types and character abilities.\r\nUnlike the first game, Borderlands 2 provided DLC not only expanding the world of Pandora with stand-alone story campaigns but adding 2 more characters. Now the main cast consists of Gunzerker Salvador(dual-wields guns at command), Siren Maya (holds and paralyzes the enemy), Commando Axton (summons turrets) and Zer0 the Assasin (invisible sniper ninja). But with the DLC players can try out summoning giant flying robots with Gaige the Mechromancer and Krieg the Psycho. \r\nMost of the game charm and popularity of Borderlands 2 comes from the supporting cast and the personalities of the NPC, making this fast-paced shooter with optional cover stand out.",

    "description": "The game that started Jak and Daxter series is a mixture of 3D platforming and puzzles delivered in a cartoonish visual style.\n\n###Setting\nJak and Daxter’s world is a distant fantasy planet. It is dominated by the ruins and technologies of an ancient civilization, the Precursors. This civilization also created eco, a type of energy that comes in different colors and can be used to various effects. There’s the dark eco that can distort life, and its Dark Sage, Gol Acheron, is going to unleash it on the world. He sent his servants, the Lurkers, to gather eco for him.\n\n###Plot\nThe player assumes the role of Jak, a mute yet troublemaking teenage boy. His best friend is a boy called Daxter. When the two explored the forbidden ruins, the Lurkers attacked them. Daxter came under the influence of dark eco and mutated into a mixture of otter and weasel he calls “ottsel.” He can still talk, however, and will comment on Jak’s actions throughout the game. Jak learns that only Gol Acheron can bring Daxter back to normal. The boy, accompanied by Daxter on his shoulder, sets out on a dangerous journey to save his friend and the world.\n\n###Gameplay\nMuch of the gameplay is centered around collecting items and resources. On each level, Jak has to obtain power cells to activate Precursors’ machines and advance to the next area. Other collectibles, such as eco particles, improve the protagonist’s attacks, health, or speed. Jak’s attacks are mostly hand-to-hand, but yellow eco allows him to shoot bolts.",

    "description": "Human Resource Machine is an educational game in which the player assumes the role of a program algorithm. The gameplay is a metaphorical representation of a visual programming language. The protagonist represents the processor register, and the player's instructions to the character stand in for the opcodes.\n\n###Premise\nThe main character is an office clerk who works in a storage department. His career lasts 40 years, each of them corresponding to an in-game puzzle. Two conveyor belts in the protagonist's office work as the input and the output devices, respectively. The input conveyor brings in the numbers and letters in the form of boxes. The protagonist is instructed to perform certain tasks and calculations with the boxes before sending them back through the output conveyor. The tasks usually require simple mathematical actions such as sorting and addition. The boxes remain stored on the office floor until the task is completed.\n\n###Gameplay\nThe player controls the character using commands that remind the assembly language. The handwritten notes represent the instructions the player gives to the character. As the player progresses through the puzzles, the game introduces more complicated concepts and mechanics, such as memory addresses. This feature allows the player to order the character to perform operations in the certain place of the office. The goal of each level is to create a program. The game will test the results and inform the player if it works or not (through a supervisor character).",

    "description": "Singularity is a shooter game developed by Raven Software. \n\n###Plot \nThe protagonist is Captain Nathaniel Renko, a part of a U.S. Recon Marines group. The action starts from an uninhabited island called Katorga-12.\nAn electromagnetic surge from the island hits an American satellite, and the unit goes there to investigate the place. Another surge damages the crew’s helicopter; Nathaniel is the only person who stays alive. He fades out to find himself in the past. At this point, the plot twists; every event in the past has an impact on the present. Back in 1955, Nathaniel meets Nikolai Demichev, a Soviet scientist working at Katorga-12. Further on, Renko and Demichev run against each other during the whole story; their interactions are at the core of the game. \n\n###Gameplay \nSingularity is the first-person shooter; the player performs the protagonist's actions. The main gameplay device is not a weapon, but an artifact called the Time Manipulation Device. Using that, the player can move the protagonists and objects around back and forth in time. At some point the player has to make choices; they affect the game result. The game also has multiplayer modes; the player can perform either as a soldier or as a creature, one of the individuals inhabiting Katorga-12. \n\n###Key features \nThe game’s concept is based on the Cold War era. Some features are inspired by exploration of military bases back in the 20th century and by sci-fi movies.",

    "description": "Unepic is a 2D platformer game with role-playing elements. The story follows Daniel, a sci-fi, and video games geek that one day was teleported into a fantasy world and found himself in a giant castle. The game’s dialogues, storyline, and aesthetics heavily relies on humor with a lot of geek-culture references and mocking on sci-fi and fantasy clichés.  \nThe gameplay can be described as a mix of 2D Metroidvania and role-playing game. The RPG elements in the game include acquiring levels, skills-points, and equipment. There are many types of armor and weapons in the that require the absolute level and skills to be used. The fighting mechanics are pretty simple and don’t have a lot of moves and abilities. Unlike many other metroidvanias, in Unepic you open new parts of the game world not by acquiring new abilities that let you go to the places you couldn’t reach before, but rather by collecting keys that unlock doors in different parts of the castle.",

    "description": "Flower is a puzzle game developed by thatgamecompany. It is a spiritual successor to thatgamecompany's Flow.\n\nThe players control the wind that picks up flower petals. You begin having only one flower petal in the air and your goal is to collect more and more petals as you go. Flying close to different flowers will get you more petals. The game's world is highly interactive as sometimes when you get more flower petals, world side-effects could occur. For example, dead flower fields can come back to life again, blossoming with vibrant colors or a windmill can begin to turn with the wind. There are no text or dialogues in the game. The developers put a strong emphasis on that Flower was not supposed to be a challenging game. The focus was that the game should arouse positive emotions using visual representation, music, and emotional clues.\n\nThere are six levels in Flower. Each level begins with a flower in a pot by the window of the flat in some unnamed city. There are no enemies and time limits in the game. It is impossible for the player to lose.",

    "description": "METAL SLUG 3 is a game in the shoot 'em up genre, a sequel to the METAL SLUG 2/METAL SLUG X and overall a third installment in the series. Initially released for arcade platform, the game shares gameplay mechanics with its predecessors, where the player takes control of a squad of four soldiers and faces continuous waves of enemies throughout each level.\nThe game’s plot follows the previous events, where the main characters succeeded in overthrowing a maniac and bringing relative peace. This time, however, it is revealed that our heroes' nemesis is back for more, with new allies and new soldiers to try and stop the protagonists. As the levels progress, the player faces different enemies, each with unique patterns and abilities, and also finds new weapons and upgrades for his character of choice. Another feature of the series is its vehicles, including tanks, planes, helicopters and even a spaceship. Each of those can be used to the various extent and provide significant bonuses to character’s firepower, defense, or movement capabilities.\nThe game is made using pixel graphics, and even though it was initially released in 2000, the sceneries and the details are still as stunning. Each character’s looks are refined, explosions are made colorful and as realistic for a 2D game as possible, and the locations themselves would look like art.",

    "description": "Sherlock Holmes: Crimes and Punishments is an adventure whodunnit by Frogware. The studio specializes on Sherlock Holmes games. 'Crimes and Punishments' is six out of seven games in the series.\n\n###Gameplay\nThe player takes a role of Sherlock Holmes — famous detective. The game consists of 6 non-related cases.\nThe first accentuation in levels is made in investigating the crime scene and searching for clues. After the examinations section comes the deduction one — the player must interconnect the evidence and find out who the culprit is. The burden of punishment is also on the playing one, thus the game title. \n\n###Story\nThree out of the six cases — The Fate of Black Peter, The Riddle on the Rails and The Abbey Grange Affair are reminiscent of the original Conan Doyle stories. Thus, the narrative flow and plot twists are adapted from the original whodunnit as well. \n\n###Features\nOne of the key features of the game is the possibility to guess the culprit wrong ergo making the false accusation. This, in turn, would affect the outcome of further cases. However, with the cases not being firmly tied down together, the impact of player's mistakes is insignificant. The loading screen as it appears rarely provides one with not only the loading bar but also the evidence to inspect and clues to examine thus using the loading time fully.",

    "description": "TowerFall is an indie action-game with focus on local multiplayer. It was initially developed as an exclusive for OUYA microconsole and was later ported on other systems as TowerFall Ascension. The gameplay represents an arcade-style fighting arena where four people combat each other to score points in a series of rounds. There are for several characters to choose from in the game. Every one of them has two main ways of killing opponents: bow and stomping. Every player starts with only 3 arrows which, after being shot, can be picked from the spot where they fell. The player can also jump on each other in retro-platformer style. The arenas exit is connected with exits on the opposite side of the map, so if the player falls down the pit, he immediately appears from the top of the arena. There also several powerups that can be found in treasure chest scattered across the map.  \r\nThe Ascension version of the game also features single-player mode in which player has to kill waves of enemies on the arena. It has no story whatsoever and is more like a series of challenges with different monsters, powerups and unique peculiarities on locations.",

    "description": "Split/Second is a racing game with an accent on the destructible environment and the game within a game mechanics.\n\n###Gameplay\nThe title features usual for the genre lap and sprint races, but the unique feature lies in the destructible environment. Unlike previous installments, utilizing such mechanics, in Split/Second the player must fill the \"power play\" bar and unleash its power on the nearby construction — for example, crush the water boiler when there are opponents underneath it. \nThe strength of the effect depends on how full the power bar is — there are two levels of damage available. The first-level collisions are mostly minor and lie in the field of damaging some constructions and crushing the billboards, while the second-level ones activate during the full bar completion are lead to the structural damage of the map facilities frequently leading to route changes and landscape altering.\n\n###Plot\nPower Play mechanics is powered by the narrative underlining it as it tells the story of a TV Show, the participators of which are all the racers including our protagonist. The meter, in this case, represents the reviews watchers give to the show members. The computer-controlled opponents can also turn on the ability and crush something on the player's vehicle — so the audience votes not only for the protagonist.",

After customizing your character, you start as a sailor under the command of a very harsh captain. One day the riot begins, and you become the new captain. Since then you can explore the world and do everything you want together with your crew.",

    "description": "Trine 2 is the second part of multiplatform puzzle sidescroller with a heavy accent on the cooperative. Being preceded by Trine, Trine 2 features one DLC: Goblin Menace, which adds six new levels and puzzles into the game.\r\nThe player in Trine 2 has to choose between three regular classes to play: the wizard, the thief, and the knight, each one with its unique abilities and skills. Singleplayer allows the player to switch between characters while in the cooperative the figure is tied to the gamer. \r\nTrine 2 features bright and shiny middle-aged levels with the essential elements glowing in the location.  The plot itself depicts the heroes' adventures as though they've just come from a fairytale book' pages. \r\nCompared to its predecessor, Trine 2 has acquired more favorable reception from the critics: while the first piece has got the average of 8 on the review aggregators, being criticised for lousy ending and enemies' monotony, the second one is said to have significant improvements and innovations.",

    "description": "Dante's Inferno is a slasher role-playing game developed by Visceral game.\n\n###Plot\nThe game is loosely based on the Divine Comedy by Dante Alighieri. The players control Dante, a veteran of crusades, looks for his beloved Beatrice who got taken by Lucifer. As Dante descends deeper into Hell, he has to face more and more horrific creatures, his own sins and the dark history of his family.\n\n###Gameplay\nThe gameplay of Dante's Inferno is similar to most slayer games. The core mechanics of the genre are to control a character who traverses different locations and eliminates every enemy they find on their path (demons in this case). The protagonist's weapons are long-ranged, allowing for the mass murder of their enemies. \n\nThe boss battles in the game are heavily inspired by God of War, where the player firstly fights with the boss and later uses a quick-time event to finish their enemy off. \n\nMultiple platforming puzzles are present in the game. The levels itself consist of multiple interconnected platforms. There are numerous spots where the players have to jump to, not without using their weapons on several occasions. \n\nTwo weapons are present in the game: the Death's Scythe and a Holy Cross, which differ both in their usage and their role in the game's character progression system. Both weapons have their own upgrade trees which require souls. Souls can be acquired by killing enemies with one of the weapons.",

    "description": "Hogwarts Legacy is an immersive, open-world action RPG set in the world first introduced in the Harry Potter books. Now you can take control of the action and be at the center of your own adventure in the wizarding world. Embark on a journey through familiar and new locations as you explore and discover fantastic beasts, customize your character and craft potions, master spell casting, upgrade talents, and become the wizard you want to be.\r\n\r\nExperience Hogwarts in the 1800s. Your character is a student who holds the key to an ancient secret that threatens to tear the wizarding world apart. You have received a late acceptance to the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and soon discover that you are no ordinary student: you possess an unusual ability to perceive and master Ancient Magic. Only you can decide if you will protect this secret for the good of all, or yield to the temptation of more sinister magic.\r\n\r\nDiscover the feeling of living at Hogwarts as you make allies, battle Dark wizards, and ultimately decide the fate of the wizarding world. Your legacy is what you make of it.",

    "description": "Steamworld Heist is a pirate-themed turn-based strategy with shooter and platformer elements. You take on the role of a pirate captain, Piper, as she recruits robots and leads them through space to capture enemy ships. The game has a side-scrolling perspective, and most levels are procedurally generated.\n\nThe main resource in the game’s universe is water, and all power try to get it. But unexpectedly one more side appears in this conflict: aggressive steambots that attack people. Only Piper can find out what’s happening and save the world.\n\nTo fulfill your mission, you need to form a team of robots to fight by your side. There’s a huge variety of potential crew members that can be found in different parts of the galaxy. To recruit them you spend water or reputation points you get completing missions. Every soldier has unique abilities and specialization that upgrade through the game. Battles are made in a classical turn-based manner with a realistic physics model that features ricochets, laser sights and bomb throwing.",

    "description": "Highly competitive soccer game with rocket-cars is the most comprehensive way to describe this game. Technically a sequel to Psyonix’ previous game - Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars; Rocket League successfully became a standalone sensation, that can be enjoyed by anyone. Easy to learn, hard to master game mechanics are perfect for the tight controls. Players are invited to maneuver the different fields within several game modes, from arcade to ranked game either 1v1, or in 2v2 and 3v3 teams. Using boosters will not only speed up the car but will allow the car to propel itself into the air.\r\nRocket League provides several levels of customization, where not only the color of your car can be adjusted, but the colors and form of the booster flame, different hats, and little flags. Or players can pick a completely different car. Collaboration with different franchises brought not only original transport but some famous cars, including Batmobile or Delorian from Back to the Future.",

    "description": "Legacy of Kain: Defiance is an action-adventure with a focus on the puzzles and the battles developed by Eidos. The game is the fifth and the last installment in the LoK series. \n\n###Gameplay\nThe series share a common mechanics — the third-person view, and the abilities mechanics — the protagonist can shapeshift and use various spells. However, Defiance brought new elements into the franchise as it implements the exp system meaning that skills and upgrades for powers can be bought for the points you gain through the progression further. Defiance is also strictly linear — there is no actual open-world and player is forced to complete the stages and chapters one by one in the given order. \nAnother difference is playable characters — this is the part in which player can gain control of Kain and Raziel. The last difference is the weaponry: both Kain and Raziel possess only Soul Reaver in its different iterations — the previous games featured a more extensive variety.\n\n###Plot\nThe title is the direct successor of Soul Reaver 2. The story centers around Kain saving Raziel and encountering Moebius the Time Streamer for the explanation of what is happening after the time paradox in the world of Nosgoth's. The characters are out for a quest of sticking Nosgoth out of the troubles they inflicted on it.",

    "description": "Gran Turismo Sport is a racing game developed by Polyphony Digital. It is the 13th game in the franchise.\n\n###Gameplay\nLike the previous games of the series, no story mode is present in Gran Turismo Sport. Three modes are available to the players: Sports, Arcade, and Campaign.\n\nSports mode allows the players to compete with each other online. Polyphony Digital puts a heavy emphasis on the addition of the official FIA Championships set of rules. The players are offered a wide range of events, competitions, and tournaments to participate in. The Sports mode is region locked in order to provide the best experience with as less network lag possible.\n\nIn Arcade mode, the players participate in events they choose on whichever vehicle available in the game against AI opponents. Usual races, Time trials, Drift trials, and two-player split-screen game modes are available to the players.\n\nThe game's Campaign mode is a classic GT experience. The players have to obtain licenses, buy used cars at first and participate in small championships on their way to the best racing leagues of the world.\n\nGran Turismo Sport features 177 vehicles for the players to use. The game has vehicles from all their history, starting with the first car ever produced, Ford Model T.",

    "description": "Salt and Sanctuary is a 2D action with role-playing elements developed by Ska Studios. \n\n###Plot and art style \nThe game follows an unnamed protagonist who escorts princess on a sail to her marriage in the distant country. The ship gets attacked by brigands that slay the whole crew and later gets destroyed by sea giant Kraekan resulting protagonist to find himself on a mysterious island. The hero must now find a way from the island and save lost princess. \nThe game is notable for its hand-drawn watercolor art style with the dark and cold palette. \n\n###Gameplay \nThe gameplay is heavily inspired by From Software’s Souls series and Castlevania franchise. The game mixes traditional Metroidvania-style exploration with several game mechanics borrowed from Dark Souls. At the beginning of the game, the player chooses one of eight classes. The class affects initial equipment of the character and his starting skills. It does not, however, affect character’s stats or restrict him from acquiring any skills from the Skill Tree later in the game. \nThe combat relies on different types of attacks, dodging, blocking and use of various abilities and items. There are more than 600 weapons, pieces of armor, disposable items and other equipment that can be found throughout the game. \nThe game features local multiplayer, both cooperative and competitive.",

    "description": "Castlevania: Lords of Shadow is a slasher game developed by MercurySteam. It is a reboot of the Castlevania game series.\n\n###Plot\nThe game takes place in a fantasy version of a middle age Europe. A member of the group of knights, calling themselves the Brotherhood of Light, defends common people from supernatural creatures. His wife was murdered by one of them, but her soul is trapped between the worlds. She comes back to her husband Gabriel and guides him to the God Masks that can bring her back to life.\n\n###Gameplay\nCastlevania: Lords of Shadow is a third-person adventure slasher title. Like in most games of this genre, Lords of Shadow focuses on short-range combat. The main weapon the player has is a chain whip called the Combat Cross. The players can use its powerful direct attacks or weak attacks that can be performed to inflict damage in a big radius. These attacks can be chained into more than forty different combo attacks.\n\nThe game features a Light and Shadow magic system, which affects the characteristics of the spells used by the player. Should one go on the path of Light, defensive spells will be used with Shadow magic using aggressive ones. It is also possible to upgrade the player's whip.\n\nJust like the previous Castlevania titles, the game features numerous puzzles and a certain degree of platforming. The Combat Cross can be used by the player to scale walls, rappel down them or swing across the pits.",

    "description": "Soul Reaver 2 is the third installment of the Legacy of Kain franchise. It continues the plot of its predecessor, Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver.\n\nPlot:\n1500 years ago the vampire overlord Kain conquered the fantasy world of Nosgoth and established a new race of immortal vampires. The Elder God, who sees vampires as an abomination against the circle of life, opposes Kain. When Kain killed his lieutenant Raziel, The Elder God brought the dead man back to life to fight against Kain. \n\nAt the beginning of Soul Reaver 2, both Raziel and Kain travel back in time to the ancient eras of Nosgoth. They both try to alter history in their favor. Raziel discovers he is the only person in Nosgoth who can evade his predefined fate, so he faces a dilemma: should he follow his predetermined past to defeat Kain, or should he break free from the bonds of destiny.\n\nGameplay:\nThe player assumes the role of Raziel, controlling him from the third person view. Raziel travels Nosgoth to fight monsters and other enemies. In the battles, he uses his Soul Reaver sword that allows him to steal the souls of his opponents. Various attacks can be used to form powerful combo movements.\n\nGathered souls allow Raziel to enter the spectral realm. It is a world of ghosts that mirrors the real world. Spiritual realm allows Raziel to regenerate his health and avoid certain obstacles. After dying in the real world, the protagonist has to continue his journey in the spirits' world.",

    "description": "Lord of the rings franchise brought a new title to the collection, an open world action-adventure game, that follows Talion, Gondor captain, that survived the sacrifice that was meant to bring the Elf Lord Celebrimbor as a wraith. Losing his wife and his son, Talion is merged with Celebrimor, escaping death.  Players will have to gain EXP in order to upgrade abilities through completing various missions and defeating Uruk warlords. Some missions might require special conditions for the greater reward.\r\nShadow of Mordor implemented the Nemesis System. It tracks the progress of every special Uruk warrior. Each special Uruk has a set of strengths and weaknesses, and players can assassinate higher ranked officers in order to promote easy to defeat Uruk to defeat them at a higher rank, weakening the Sauron’s army. This planning allows players to adapt, and use mechanics of stealth kills, ranged combat, wraith skills and head-on melee more effective.",

    "description": "Nex Machina is a sci-fi game about fighting robots and saving humans. It is a spiritual successor to the 1982 arcade Robotron 2084. The original game's designer Eugene Jarvis consulted Nex Machina creators.\n\n###Plot\nThe game is set in the futuristic world that was recently taken over by a machines' uprising. The robots try to annihilate humans and send \"Harvesters\" to hunt for them. The protagonist is the last warrior who can stand up for the humankind.\n\n###Gameplay\nThe player controls his or her character from the top-down view. Nex Machina contains six worlds divided by 15 levels. Each world ends with a boss fight. The player's primary objective is to defeat enemies, but there's also an optional objective to save humans scattered around levels.\n\n###Modes\nThere are two main modes. In the Single World, the worlds are consecutive, while in Arcade mode, the player can choose which world to play this time. The game has a local co-op and a competitive Online Arena mode, but no online cooperative multiplayer.\n\n###Combat system\nThe protagonist has several types of attacks. The regular gun can be upgraded by power-ups to increase its range and spread. There are also stronger additional weapons, such as a sword and an energy beam. The game aims to keep the action at a high tempo and puts an emphasis on the \"flow\" and timing. By using the character's attacks in the right progressions, the player can perform powerful combo movements.",

    "description": "Manhunt is a third-person stealth-action game developed by Rockstar Games. The game caused a lot of controversy for its violent scenes.\n\n###Plot\nA death sentenced convict James awakens in Carcer City after his supposed execution by lethal injection. The protagonist finds himself equipped with an earpiece, in which he hears the voice of The Director. The Director offers James freedom in turn for helping The Director shoot his violent TV show. It is said that a gang called The Hoods is patrolling the neighborhood killing everyone they spot. James has to survive the night in Carcer City in order to get his freedom.\n\n###Gameplay\nThe players have to traverse multiple locations to complete a specific list of tasks. These tasks come down to getting somewhere, murdering a gang member, and finding items. \n\nThere is a group of special enemies called The Hunters which run to the players as soon as they are spotted. The game features an advanced stealth system. The players can be hidden in the shadows, yet if they step on something, a noise will be made, which can attract The Hunters.\n\nThere are two ways of executing an enemy - a direct confrontation or a stealth kill. It is much harder to kill an enemy using the first way, as the game encourages the players to use stealth kills. These stealth kills are often referred to as Executions. There are three types of executions, with each one varying in their speed and violence.",

    "description": "The series of video games, known for the destructiveness of virtual environments. The action takes place at the end of the 21st century. Humanity has colonized Mars and now is extracting minerals that are no longer available on Earth. The player takes control over the miner who goes by the name Parker, and who helps rebel forces with the uprising against the evil Ultor Corporation. The latter is entirely out of hand and violates the fundamental human rights: does not provide workers food and medicine and treats miners as slaves.\n\nThe main game mechanics is the GeoMod technology, which allows players to extensively change the virtual environment. For example, with the help of explosives or other improvised instruments. Unavailable earlier freedom of action allowы players to complete levels non-linearly, and change them beyond recognition. The version for the PC included an additional level of Glass House, in which GeoMod's capabilities could be used in full, and a multiplayer with 25 maps.",

    "description": "Momodora: Reverie Under The Moonlight takes the player on a journey through a cursed land on the brink of eradication. Evil spreads, the dead rise, and corruption reigns. Hope is but a faded memory for all but one: a priestess named Kaho from the village of Lun. If only Kaho could somehow gain audience with the Queen, Her Majesty could surely be convinced to lend her power to help save the land and its inhabitants from certain doom―but time is short, and each coming night falls darker than the last...\nReverie Under The Moonlight is the fourth installment in the Momodora series of side-scrolling action platformers, featuring melee combos, dodge mechanics, and a plethora of items and spells to unleash upon your enemies. Play casually to fully take in and enjoy the rich setting and engaging, mysterious story, or crank up the difficulty to run your reflexes through a truly brutal gauntlet.\nBeautifully animated graphics\nExciting action gameplay: pull off impressive combos, dodge attacks, and skewer enemies with arrows\nIntense boss battles with challenging patterns and epic scale\nDifficulty settings appropriate for all types of players―from story and setting lovers to hardcore action enthusiasts\nA breadth of items that can be combined to facilitate new strategies\nAn amazingly diverse world to explore, filled with secrets and treasures\nEccentric allies and foes with compelling personalities\nMysterious lore and rich backstory woven into events, dialogue, and item descriptions\nFor this fourth installment in the Momodora series―which actually serves a prequel to the previous games―the primary focus during development was on improvements to the gameplay and art. The combat gameplay has truly evolved since the days of Momo III, and the character sprites are now bigger and better animated.\nWe also made an effort to include more tiny details here and there, expand on the world lore, and create more exciting boss battles.\nI believe this is the best Momodora game in the series, and definitely the most polished title so far.\nMost of us at Playism grew up playing video games during the early days of the NES, and throughout the years, action-platformers have been some of the staples in our respective game libraries. Long before “Metroidvania” was a thing, we fell in love with the original Castlevania series, as well as with other Hall of Famers such as the Metroid, Contra, and Ninja Gaiden games. About halfway through the lifecycle of the first-generation PlayStation, sprite-based game development took an unfortunate nosedive, and the sorts of games we loved most and grew up with just weren't being made as frequently or, frankly, with as much love and care as they once were.\nIndie game development really helped to reinvigorate both the sprite-based action-platformer genre and the magic of actual sprite animation. rdein's games combine what we’ve always loved about tight-action 2D gaming with splendid influences from more modern games like Dark Souls. The dedication to your actions necessitated by animation locks; the insane intensity driving the boss fights and how epic it is that this quaint little heroine can tackle these heroic endeavors; the attention to detail in the environments, designs, and animations... all of this stuff is simply stunning and rdein pulls it off to beautiful effect.\nThen there’s also the story itself, which is also a masterpiece in game storytelling: a strange, mysterious world that you inhabit with countless hopeless souls whom you are trying to save. There is painstaking detail in every item, every snippet of dialogue. You find yourself constantly readjusting how you feel about these people. You're trying to save them, but do they even want to be saved? Or should you be more worried about that awkwardly sinister tone in their voices...?\nMomodora: RUTM shouldn’t exactly be categorized as “Metroidvania” or “Souls-like”, but there certainly are elements of both contained within. It's a game of its own, and it’s one of the best entries in the mind-bogglingly expansive genre of side-scrolling action-platformers. We at Playism all love the game, and we can state with absolute confidence that if you’ve bothered to read this far, then you certainly will, too.",

    "description": "Ultra Street Fighter IV is a multiplatform fighting game developed by Capcom. It is an arcade version of the vanilla Street Fighter IV with minor changes.\n\n###Setting\nUltra Street Fighter IV takes place several months after the events of Street Fighter II and is a prequel to Street Fighter III. After the return of Bison, who was presumed to be killed in the last tournament, a weapon corporation named S.I.N announces a new event to gather all the world's mightiest fighters for the creation of a powerful weapon of mass destruction. \n\n###Gameplay\nAll in all, SF IV is a two-dimensional fighting game with post-processed cell-shaded graphics, resembling the art style of Japanese comics.\n\nThe game features the classic six-button control scheme with several additions that were made to refresh the gameplay. The combat system inherits the principles, that were introduced in SF III, such as the enhanced special attacks. Special button combos were added to implement fast movement inside an arena. \n\nThere are two energy bars in the game, one of which is used for Super Combos, special attacks called EX Special Moves, and Focus Cancels. The other one is called the Revenge Gauge and is used for executing ultra-combos.\n\n###Ultra Edition features\nThe Ultra Street Fighter was initially released on Japanese arcade machines but was later made available to the general public. Apart from the standard balancing changes and updated combat system, it features new characters and arenas.",

    "description": "Ghost of a Tale is an action-RPG game in which you play as Tilo, a mouse and minstrel caught up in a perilous adventure. The game takes place in a medieval world populated only by animals, and puts an emphasis on immersion and exploration. It features stealth elements, disguises, conversations with allies and enemies, and quests.\nYou’ll be able to explore the secrets of Dwindling Heights Keep and navigate its dangers. Tilo is not much of a fighter, so stealth and nimbleness are your allies when confronted with enemies twice your size. Talk to the characters you meet and leave no stone unturned in your quest to find Merra, your true love….About the team:\nGhost of a tale is developed by a very small team. Lionel \"Seith\" Gallat does 90% of the art, design and coding. Paul Gardner is the game's writer and an experienced game designer. Cyrille Paulhiac does coding and develops tools. Jeremiah Pena is the game's composer, while Nicolas Titeux is responsible for sound design.",

    "description": "The sequel to Crysis is set three years after the original. All events of the 2020 incident, especially the human-alien conflict, were kept secret, and CryNet Systems is hunting for survivors of the first contact. However, the extraterrestrial race of Ceph did not give up its plans on the Earth. Crysis 2 introduces the new protagonist, a US Marine codenamed Alcatraz. Prophet, the squad leader from Crysis, also makes an appearance, and his recorded memories guide Alcatraz as he uncovers the alien plot. As in every game of the series, the protagonist is armed with a futuristic Nano Muscle Suit, a military exoskeleton that adsorbs damage, heals and strengthens the wearer. The suits were updated since Crysis, introducing modules for suit customization and a new Tactical mode. The player can now use multiple suit modes at the same time. \r\nMost levels are set in the urban environment this time to distinguish the game from the original. Alcatraz is eventually tasked with defending New York from the alien invasion, and the battle ensues at iconic places like Times Square. The game also includes a multiplayer mode that pits the United States Marine Corps against C.E.L.L. mercenaries.",

    "description": "Deadly Premonition: The Director's Cut is an open-world horror game with a dramatic shift to the exploring the world and realistic time-management. It is a reboot of a previous game of its developers — Access Games. Rainy Woods has never been published due to technological problems. \nThroughout the game, the player, as Francis York Morgan — the FBI policeman — tries to inquire the identity of a Raincoat Killer. We can explore the in-game world by foot or with the help of a car. Walking by foot consumes more time and strength, but driving a car forces the player to buy fuel and compensate for repairs.\nThe game also features combat mechanics — the player may use the melee weapons and firearms against the forces of another world. The latter, however, cannot catch sight of them if they get a hold of their breath.\nThe story follows the investigation of the murder of Anna Graham,. The events depicted take place in the universe in which good and evil intentions may be shared within the world by the messengers.",

    "description": "This prequel to the very first game in the God of War series and the seventh game in the franchise. It is exclusive for the Sony PlayStation 3 console. The game still uses the ancient Greek mythology as visual inspiration and the primary story source.\n\nThe player takes control over the warrior Kratos. At the beginning of the game, the protagonist was imprisoned after he violated the blood oath given to the god of war Ares. One of the three goddesses of revenge Megera tortures Kratos, but he manages to break free and start the path to revenge on the gods of Olympus.\n\nKratos still uses the dual Blade of Chaos. They can be improved, but this is not the only weapon in the game: other weapons are available for purchase thanks to the new World Weapons mechanics. The gameplay is no different from the other games of the series: the player still needs to connect the attacks in combos and arrange hack and slash mayhem. This is the only game in the series, in which multiplayer is available for eight people: the main task is to seize control of the card and get a reward from the gods.",

    "description": "Owlboy is a pixel-art platformer game about an owl-humanoid boy called Otus. When his homeland was attacked by pirates, Otus starts an adventure to protect his home and reveal the secrets of his race. He makes new friends on the way. Each of them has special powers, useful during fights.\n\nOwlboy features classic platforming gameplay with a twist: unlike in many hardcore games of this genre, here you can fly and have almost no chance to die by falling. Otus can pick things up and use them as weapons or to solve puzzles. There are several ways to complete the same missions; your choice depends on your imagination only. Also, there are suitable tactics for different enemy types: while you can defeat some of them with direct force, the others can be destroyed in more creative ways.\n\nThe game’s world is organized like a huge cylinder with Otus’ village on the bottom; during the game you will fly higher and higher. Missions are set in separate locations; after completing them you will return to the central hub to get new quests.",

    "description": "Shantae and the Pirate's Curse is an action platform game, the third installment in WayForward’s Shantae series.  \n\n###Plot \nThe game follows the half-genie Shantae and takes place after an event of the Shantae: Risky’s Revenge. The main heroine abandons her genie powers and stars adjusting to the life of a regular human being. One day she comes across the previous game’s antagonist, a pirate named Risky Boots that tells her about evil and fearsome tyrant Pirate Master sealed long ago by genies wants to revive himself using Dark Magic. Now Shantae must form an unexpected alliance with her past rival to stop Pirate Master. \n\n###Gameplay \nRegarding gameplay, Shantae and the Pirate’s Curse shares many similarities with previous games in the series. It is a 2D side-scroller that is not divided into several levels but rather takes place in one interconnected world. The game mostly consists of fighting enemies, solving puzzles, platforming sections, interacting with different NPC that can give you quests or sell useful items. Since Shantae abandoned her genie powers, in this game you do not use magic abilities, instead of throughout the game you collect different pirate items such as a pistol, a pirate hat, pirate boots, scimitar, and cannon. Each of them gives player new abilities that help in combat, puzzle solving or open previously closed areas of the game world.",

    "description": "Golden Abyss is the fourth game in the Uncharted franchise, although it’s a spin-off rather than a part of the main series. It serves as a prequel to Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception. The player controls the series’ main protagonist, the adventurer Nathan Drake. In Golden Abyss, Drake arrives at an archeological dig site in Panama alongside fellow treasure hunters Marisa Chase and Jason Dante. Before they investigate the artifacts they found, Dante betrays his partners to a mercenary leader Roberto Guerro. The villains believe that the findings can lead to Quivira, a secret city of gold. Nathan and Marisa have to escape captivity and save the artifacts from the enemy.\nGolden Abyss became the first Uncharted game released for a portable console, PS Vita, and it uses the console’s touch screen as part of the controls. Otherwise, the gameplay didn’t change much since the original Uncharted. It combines intricate platforming and acrobatics with the elements of a third-person shooter and puzzle-solving. One of the few features the game introduces is that Drake can use his journal and photo camera to search for clues to the puzzles and identify locations. Golden Abyss has no multiplayer options.",

    "description": "The fourth game in the post-apocalyptic action RPG series from Bethesda studious brings players back to the retro-future. After customizing the facial features of the character, players will be admitted to the Vault 111 with their family, and tricked into entering the cryogenic capsule. After the rude awakening after the unknown amount of time has passed, the child is separated from the parents and the loving partner is killed in front of them – the main quest is settled. Now there’s only the giant open world to explore. Fallout 4 introduces the mechanics of settlement building, where players can build their own little town. Gathering material for crafting and building brings more “survival” elements into the old formula. Within their own settlements, players will be able to build all needed utilities, from storage spaces to power armor stations. Visual upgrade from the previous game brings life to what used to be brown wastelands, now filled with details and color.",

    "description": "Driver: San Francisco is the fifth game in the Driver franchise. It is a game about chases with a crime thriller plot.\r\n\r\n###Plot\r\nPlotwise, Driver: San Francisco serves as a sequel to Driver 3 rather than the previous installment, Driver: Parallel Lines. As with the rest of the Driver series, the main character is John Tanner, a police detective, and a talented driver. Tanner is chasing the mobster Charles Jericho who survived the events of Driver 3. \r\n\r\nWhile awaiting trial in San Francisco, Jericho escapes the custody and wrecks chaos in the city. Tanner is injured and falls into a coma. While unconscious, the protagonist discovers he has a supernatural power to inhabit other people's bodies. It allows him to continue the chase.\r\n\r\n###Gameplay\r\nThe game is set in a thoroughly modeled San Francisco complete with its famous landmarks. Unlike in the three previous games, Tanner cannot leave the car and walk around. Instead, Driver: San Francisco introduces a new option called Shift, using which the protagonist instantly changes vehicles. This is explained as a supernatural ability to switch bodies. \r\n\r\nThe game also reintroduces the popular Film Director mode. It allows the player to replay his or her adventures using various cameras so that the walkthrough video looks almost like a movie.\r\n\r\n###Multiplayer\r\nThe game is the first in the series to introduce both local and online multiplayer. There are several modes that include a vehicular tag game and other variations of a competitive chase game.",

Commanding units with top-down perspective allow players to plan ahead and Players form a professional team with five different classes and can deploy up to ten operatives based on mission conditions. The game has more than 80 single missions, six multilevel missions, randomly generated missions, and community-generated content. \nMissions are based on different in-game objectives, from total elimination to saving a VIP and disarming bombs. Each mission will be rated after the completion with a three-star rating. On top of the actual missions, players can try out to complete challenges, like completing a mission with only a squad member or complete it with a perfectly executed plan. The difficulty arises with the fact, that enemy positions are switched every time mission starts.",

    "description": "###The succsessor\nPrototype 2 - developed by Radical Entertainment is a science-fiction adventure shooter with a third-person view in the open world. The publisher was Activision, and the game was released on April 24, 2012, on PS3 and Xbox 360, and then, on July 24, 2012, on PC. Later, in August 2015, it was released on consoles of the next generation - PS4 and Xbox One.\n\n###The setting\nThe action takes place in a city called New York Zero, where an epidemic is raging, and its territory is divided into zones. The player will try on the role of Sergeant James Heller, who serves in the Middle East. It all begins at the moment when his wife calls and says that the epidemic has begun again in the city and they are at the epicenter with their daughter. Returning home, James discovers that his family is dead and now his task is to find someone who, in his opinion, is the culprit of these deaths.\n\n###Key features\nCruel and bloody Prototype 2 is the second game of the series. It seems that, compared to the first part, the gory feel is becoming bigger. The game is allowing you to run and jump almost anywhere and do whatever the player wants - anarchy! But despite the fact that the game takes place in an open world, a player can feel some linearity of events. According to lead designer Matt Armstrong, this was done purposefully so that the player would feel the development of the storyline and wouldn’t be afraid of too many options, and have the opportunity to open new territories gradually, thereby more effectively upgrading his character and immerse in the game’s universe.",

    "description": "Worms is a turn-based strategy game developed by Team17. It is the first installment of the Worms series of games.\n\nWorms is a two-dimensional game. The gameplay is similar to the strategies of the time, such as Scorched Earth. The player controls a team of four worms. The objective of the game is to eliminate the enemy team. The player and the AI take turns on which they control a randomly selected worm from their team. During each turn, the player can use any weapon available to them or change the position of a worm. Upon hitting a worm, it's health points are taken away. The worms die on two occasions: if their health points reach zero or they hit the water. The levels are interactive and their landscapes are destructible, which affects the gameplay.\n\nPlayers have access to a wide variety of weapons. Apart from RPGs, grenades, and UZI, the game features unusual weapons such as banana bombs or explosive sheep. During the game, weapon crates are dropped from the sky. Players also can use tools such as a blowtorch or a drill, that affect the landscape itself.\n\nIt is possible to customize the games settings, such as the available weapons, the time limit of a turn and a round.",

    "description": "Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2 is an action-adventure and a straight continuation of the first part of the franchise. It is also 39th part of the vast Castlevania series. The game currently features no successors.\n\n###Gameplay\nThe game, unlike its predecessor, features an open-world structure. The player follows the adventures of Gabriel Belmont through medieval settings and modern environments. Sometimes — at the start of the story, to be precise — the players gain control of Dracula who possesses Gabriel and gives him similar powers. The game consists of many fighting sequences in which combos are of importance — the various swords and claws, some allowing the protagonist to replenish his health and the other dealing massive damage to the enemies.\n\n###Story\nThe game is highly story-driven. At the start, the developers present the players with the scenes of flashbacks, in which the transformation to Dracula is shown.

    "description": "DuckTales Remastered is a platforming game developed by Capcom. It is the reboot of the original DuckTales released on NES.\n\nAfter The Beagle Boys go after Scrooge's money once again, a mysterious painting was found by Big Time Beagle and was left at Scrooge's manor. The painting reveals the five treasures and Scrooge sets out to find them.\n\nDuckTales Remastered is a 2.5-dimensional game. The character sprites are 2D and are hand-drawn while the levels are 3D modeled. The gameplay resembles the same of the original game. The players control Scrooge on his quest to find the treasures around the world. The duck defends himself by swinging his cane or jumping on objects with it like a pogo stick. Various diamonds and coins are scattered across the levels. The character's health is restored using various candy.\n\nThe game features five levels from the original game which were greatly expanded. It is up to the player to define in which order to play all of the levels. In every level, the player has to complete a certain objective and defeat a unique boss.",

Rising Storm 2: Vietnam casts players into a brutal, authentic recreation of the Vietnam War.\nRising Storm 2: Vietnam offers intense tactical action for up to 64 players in battles between the US forces and the Vietnamese, with each force having their own unique abilities and tactical advantages such as Napalm Strikes, Artillery Barrages, surface-to-air missiles, traps, ambushes and more.\nA variety of authentic period weapons available including the M16, M14, M60, M79 and M3 Grease Gun for the Americans; and the Type 56 Assault Rifle (a Chinese copy of the famous AK-47), RPG-7, MAT-49, SKS Carbine and many, many more for the Vietcong.\nWeapons also have a wide range of functionality with in-game implications, including adjustable stocks, attachable bayonets, and a new and advanced recoil system which builds on the already phenomenal weapon handling that the Red Orchestra series is famous for.\n\nPlayers on the US team will be able to pilot 3 different helicopters - the UH-1H \"Huey\" transport, the OH-6 \"Loach\" light recon and the powerful AH-1G \"Cobra\" attack helicopter.\nPlay as both the United States Military and Vietnamese resistance fighters. Rising Storm 2: Vietnam allows players to control either the U.S. Army and Marines Corps or the militarized and guerrilla forces of North Vietnam - the NVA and the Viet Cong.\nEach map faithfully recreates the look of the Vietnam experience and aims to pull players directly into the war with its extreme authenticity to real life.\nMaps will include the famous jungles of Vietnam, but will also cover battles that occurred in cities, on rolling hills, in US Firebases, Rice Fields, Plantations and many more authentic locations.\nGame types include Red Orchestra's classic territory control mode, the new Supremacy mode, for large-scale combat including helicopters, VC tunnels and more, as well as the new smaller Skirmish mode and maps designed for 16 or less players.\nThese new smaller maps are designed to be a more competitive, squad-based experience that reflect the small unit actions that Vietnam is famous for.\nEnhanced squad system that allows players to set up squads as they want them - name them, add their friends, set the squad tag color in game. Once in game, easy identification of your squad in the world and on maps - and dedicated VOIP channels for the squad, as well as bonuses for working together.\nRising Storm 2: Vietnam's focus will be player skill and balance. We won't be locking content like weapon upgrades, improved player characteristics or new armaments behind a rank or experience system. We want to put the tools to succeed in the hands of every player.\nRising Storm 2: Vietnam will allow players to customize their player characters with additional uniform and equipment variants earned as they play. These will include new headgear, clothing, tattoos, glasses and more.",

    "description": "Evoland is a role-playing video game. It is the debut project by French development company Shiro Games. \n\n###Plot and setting \nThe game is centered on the theme of action-adventure video games evolution. It takes place in the world of Evolandia and follows a typical story of a chosen one and his fight against evil forces. The game’s dialogues, items descriptions, and overall style are filled with humor, parody, and references to iconic video game series. \n\n###Gameplay \nThe main feature of the game is unlocking of graphical, sound and gameplay improvements. The game starts as a monochrome top-down adventure with no sound and gradually, as the player progresses through the story, transforms into full-fledged 3D RPG with soundtrack, different settlements throughout the game world, side-quests, NPCs and equipment system. \nEvoland’s gameplay continually changes. It can be divided into three main parts, each one resembling a certain game series. The first is top-down adventure similar to older The Legend of Zelda titles. Like Zelda, it features different puzzles and dungeons throughout the game. Then the game changes its combat system to turn-based imitating Final Fantasy series with its random encounters and party system. After that, it becomes the top-down hack-n-slash game in the style of Diablo series with the accent on obtaining various loot.",

    "description": "The Sexy Brutale is a puzzle-adventure game with investigation elements.  \n\n###Plot \nThe game takes place in a luxurious mansion called The Sexy Brutale where a big masquerade party occurs. The story follows Lafcadio Boone — a preacher who becomes a witness of the series of mysterious murders and finds out that the mansion is stuck in a 12 hours long time loop.\nA mysterious woman appears and gives Boone an ability to pull himself out of this anomaly by manipulating the time inside with magical pocket watch. Now Lafcadio must save his friends from the death and identify the killer.\n  \n###Gameplay \nThe game is divided into several 12-hour periods. In each of them, your goal is to save one of the guests from the murderer. You explore the mansion, discover its secrets and learn about the partygoers. Because of your abilities to avoid the effects of the time loop, you have to sneak behind the guests without being seen. The gameplay heavily focuses on the puzzle-solving. To save the partygoers, you usually have to investigate the murder set, decide which objects you can manipulate to prevent the crime, rewind the time and execute your plan without being noticed. With every character saved, Boone gets new powers that improve his skills such as lockpicking or hearing. The game has a secret ending that you can unlock by collecting all of the 52 hidden cards.",

    "description": "Halo 5: Guardians is an FPS game developed by 343 Industries.\n\nSet in 2558, 8 months after Halo 4, the plot revolves around two fireteams. Blue Team with Master Chief acting as a commanding officer and Fireteam Osiris led by Jameson Locke. Blue Team goes AWOL in order to find Master Chief's old comrade while Osiris is sent after the Team on a capture and retrieve mission.\n\nLike in previous titles, the players control a SPARTAN, biologically engineered supersoldiers that use the MJOLNIR battle armor. This armor has energy shields that deplete upon receiving any damage but regenerate after a certain amount of time. The players are capable of carrying two firearms at a time, but it is possible to pick up every weapon dropped by the enemy.\n\nUnlike the previous installments where the player could only be followed by NPCs in singleplayer but had the ability to play in a separate co-op mode, Halo 5 takes the concept further and now every of four fireteam members can be controlled by a player. The game does not feature any autonomous features like split-screen on LAN play.",

    "description": "Deadpool wants to be the main protagonist of the game developed by High Moon Studios and in order to make them develop the game, he plants explosives in the studio. Deadpool even hires Nolan North to voice the protagonist. After Deadpool receives the scenario from the studio, he finds it boring and edits it with a pencil. The game continues according to the edited scenario after this point.\n\nIt is a combination of action, hack & slash and a third-person shooter, where new hit combos are unlocked further into the game. In order to get new combos, the players have to kill a certain amount of enemies. The main feature of the game is the breaking of the fourth wall by Deadpool. The protagonist often talks to the player directly, shares his opinion on the player's performance and reveals parts of the plot. The combat gameplay revolves around combining both melee and ranged attacks. The player can change Deadpool's equipment on-the-go. Deadpool has the same regenerative powers as Wolverine and will get blown up into pieces on some plot occasions.",

    "description": "Small freeware game Octodad has found a lot of popularity as a simple comedic demo of a game engine and the controls over the octopus, successfully trying to pretend to be a human. Octodad: Dadliest Catch is a direct and full-fledged sequel to the game, telling a story of a smart and resourceful octopus. We follow Octodad on his day to day activities, until the day when his past caught up to him, and now he has to save his family from the man that knows his secret identity. The cook by the name Fujimoto kidnaps the Family of Octodad, and now the player will have to find their way to save them.\nThe game control scheme is notorious among the fans because players have to control one of two sets of tentacles as arms and legs, switching between the two with a press of a button. All that, while trying to perform simple or complicated tasks, like finding things or picking up objects. The game is divided into several levels, each with a list of objectives.",

    "description": "In Resogun, the player pilots a small futuristic airship trying to shoot down wave after wave of airborne enemies. Its graphics are based on voxels (3D pixels), which provide a simple yet colorful visual style reminiscent of Lego constructions or pixel art. All five levels vaguely remind neon-lighted, skyscraper-dominated metropolises at night. They are also based on an unusual cylindrical, ring-shaped design. The levels rotate when the airship moves right or left and scroll when you fly up or down. Each level ends with a boss fight. \nEliminating enemies is the main objective in Resogun, but there’s also an optional objective to save the prisoners from their cages. Rescuing humans earns the player additional points, which is essential to set the high score. There are three modes: the Arcade mode, in which you simply pass through the consecutive levels; the Single Level mode, in which your goal is to obtain the highest score on a certain level; and a cooperative multiplayer for two. The player can select one of three airships that have different characteristics. Difficulty can also be adjusted on a scale from Rookie to Hero.",

    "description": "UNO is a video game adaptation of a famous card game developed in the 20th century. The aim is to be the first one to win 500 points. There is also a variation of the game called Uno Rush, announced two years later than the original.\n\n###Gameplay \nThe rules and card design do not differ from the original. Four players are sitting across the table.\nEvery player can check out his points in the composite chart. The round proceeds clockwise, it is supported by the revolving arrows and sound effects. The deck consists of 108 cards, 25 of each color. When it’s a player’s turn to go, he has to match the top card in the discard pile based on color, number or symbol of the card. They are dealt automatically to each player. It lets one focus on the game itself rather than on the mechanics.   \n\n###Key Features \nThe main visual appearance is a red screen and slow music so that the game screen can set up the background. There is not much action in the setting as the main processes appear between the players. Just like the original, one can’t see the opponents’ decks, so their goal is to become the first one to gain points. The player can also change the appearance in different game versions. For example, in Partner Uno the player with partners sit across from each other; the Xbox Live Version supports the webcams, which makes the action more intense. The video game has several teams over the internet, so it is possible to participate in live tournaments with players from around the world.",

    "description": "Tearaway Unfolded is an action-adventure game developed by Media Molecule. It is a sequel to Tearaway.\n\nThe players control a messenger that is delivering a message to a portal opened in the sky which displays the players themselves. The players are referred to as \"The You\" in the game.  The messenger has to deliver the message in order to save their paper world.\n\nAt the beginning of the game, the player chooses one out of two characters. The choice does not affect gameplay whatsoever, only the look of your character. The main feature of the game is the interaction with the environment using the features of the DualShock 4. The players go through a world that is completely made out of paper. Your playable character can jump, grab and roll.\n\nIn order to progress through the game, the player has to modify the surroundings so new paths can be opened. The players have several tools at their disposal, such as a vacuum cleaner that can move items and can be used to defeat enemies.",

    "description": "Hand of Fate is an unusual combination of various genres. It is based on mechanics typical for deck-building board games, but also features rogue-like and hack-and-slash elements. Its approach to the storytelling is typical for tabletop RPGs like Dungeons and Dragons. \nYou play cards against the Dealer, who is both your DM, opponent, and narrator of your adventures. Each card represents an item, a character, or an encounter. You navigate your character through the story that unfurls as you reveal the cards and make your choices. The goal is to collect a powerful deck of cards that give your character better weapons, armor, and other equipment. You can unlock more cards after you defeat bosses and complete quests. The Dealer’s goal is to hamper your progress, as he plays his cards to put new obstacles in your way.\nMost of the time the game will only show you the cards and the Dealer who sits across the table from you. You will learn the events from listening to him and reading the text on cards. Battles, however, are actually fought in real time by animated characters on visualized 3D arenas. This is very unusual for board game simulators and brings some variety into the gameplay.",

    "description": "###The help from Kickstarter backers\nThis is a role-playing game with roguelike elements from the independent British studio Failbetter Games. The money was collected on Kickstarter, just 4 271 backers supported the game, and donated a little over a hundred thousand pounds to its development. The game is available for solo completion on PC, Mac, and Linux.\n\n###Story and setting\nThe player tries on the role of the captain of the ship. Captain's backstory is fully customizable. The game is a spin-off for the browser game Fallen London from the same developers: the action takes place in the same universe and at the same time. The game mixes the Victorian era and the mystical atmosphere of Lovecraft's books. The player sails between different islands of the underground sea, facing different dangers. To win, you need to achieve a certain goal: for example, to find a treasure or to gain the title of the most famous seafarer by transporting goods and opening new lands.\n\n###Key Features\nDeath is permanent in the game - the player starts all over again after each defeat. Developers have added the ability to inherit some of the property or team of the predecessor. The game world is randomly generated, although the location of the main ports and islands remains unchanged.",

    "description": "LEGO Harry Potter: Years 5-7 is an action-adventure utilizing LEGO thematics and mechanics. The game is the part of the vast LEGO franchise and is released by Traveller's Tales — the studio specializing in LEGO since 2006. This is the second part of the Harry Potter LEGO arc with the first one being Years 1-4 title.\n\n###Gameplay\nThe game features mechanics same for all of the LEGO games — the core characteristic of them is collecting LEGO blocks while proceeding through the levels: the environment can be destroyed to some extent (basic surroundings like grass and walls are indestructible), the crafting part looks like an assembly of a constructor kit. \nThe title implements conditionally open world consisting of various locations reminiscent from the original book. The player can travel between locations after the completing of the main story to mop up the collectibles and find an interaction that was earlier inaccessible due to lack of special powers and moves. Such skills are usually acquired within the first playthrough. The game does not feature an online multiplayer, unlike its predecessor.\n\n###Story\nThe plot of the game generally follows the last three books and four films about the Harry Potter's adventures. The game starts with events depicted in The Order of the Phoenix film and ends with a fight with Lord Voldemort.",

    "description": "A series, that brought players several notable titles, was mostly set in 2D because artillery turn-based games have a set of mechanics that compliment the closed maps and complicated terrain. But Worms Ultimate Mayhem is a modernized remake of the different direction, taken by the Team 17. This game is a direct remake of Worms 4: Mayhem, expanding the movement mechanics to the 3D environments.\nWorms Ultimate Mayhem adds several features to the typical Worms gameplay. Each player controls a team of 4 or fewer worms and can control one worm at a time, moving around, using items and attacking in a set amount of time. Then after each player moved and attacked in turn with all of their characters round starts over, and the game goes until only one player or a team left. There’s an option for players to play a single player campaign and challenges, from the previous Worms 3D games, or a match against bots with an improved AI. But any Worms have multiplayer modes, both local and online, with ranked matches. Each worm team can be customized with names, voices, hats, signature weapon, taunts and tombstones. Added in-game voice chats and real-time lighting, shaders and post process effects are adding to the improved design and comfortability.",

    "description": "Dead Rising was a specific iteration of an open world action horror game that is considered to be a beat ‘em up. The difference is that it’s a zombie survival with horror elements and crafting mechanics. The protagonist, Frank West, is sneaking into the Willamette to gather information on the reasons why is it being sealed by the National Guard. After landing on the roof of the big shopping mall, Frank asks the pilot to pick him up in 72 hours. Inside Frank learns of a massive zombie outbreak, and a threat of it nationwide infestation.\nIn order to complete missions, the player will have to explore the shopping mall and fend off the zombies. Frank has access to more than 250 items that can be used as weapons, ranging from low to high damage. Some of the weapons might have environmental properties, like being heated on the open fire. All weapons can be used a limited amount of times in order to make the player explore and search for random encounters, with struggling survivors that need saving, or “psychopaths” that act as mini-bosses. The game uses RPG elements, where the player earns Prestige Points that can be spent to improve skills and attributes. As a photographer, Frank has a camera that can be used to take pictures, that are rated and their rating score is converted into the Prestige Points.",

    "description": "Lara Croft GO is a turn-based isometric puzzle game drawn in material design style. This is the fourth spin-off of the enormous Tomb Raider series.\n\n###Gameplay\nThe game ties turn mechanics and adventure game — even though it sounds contradictory, this merger works. So, the game features usual Tomb Raider gameplay which is: raiding tombs, exploring crypts and fighting multiple enemies. \nDuring forty levels divided into five chapters the player must take turns — he can go into one of four directions — left, right, up and down. The time given for turns is unlimited, so it is the move-when-ready type of title.\nGoing through levels namely means learning foes' moving patterns and memorizing the locations of all traps within the level. Lara can climb cliffs and hang down from the ledges to avoid being detected by opponents. The new types of traps and things to avoid are evolving with every next level. \nGO also features “look-for-objects” genre as the player is allowed to collect vases throughout the levels\n\n###Plot\nThe narrative in the title transfers itself via visuals, not dialogues, so it is hard to compose any meaningful story with it. The absence of subsequent storytelling may be explained with the hints mechanics — it is utterly troublesome to translate a story arc if the help may be requested at any time and level would be over in no time.",

    "description": "A game that began life as a tech demo, but became a meme instead. The question \"But can it run Crysis?\" is the true measurement of PC power. Designed by the German studio Crytek Crysis 3 continues the story begun in the second part.\n\nThe year is 2047, New York, where evil corporation CELL built Nanodome on top of the city and turned the metropolis into a real jungle. In addition to mundane enemies, the alien race of Ceph threatens humanity who pursues its goals. The player gains control of Prophet - a soldier in nano suit, whose primary goal is to stop the leader of the alien race.\n\nTurning into a jungle landscape one of the most recognizable cities in the world, allowed developers to diversify the gameplay. Together with the nano suit, they transformed the classic first-person shooter into a vast fast-paced sandbox. It depends solely on the player how to complete each level. In addition to a solo story campaign, the game has a multiplayer with 8 modes and 12 maps.",

    "description": "TF2 is an objective based arena shooter with unique characters, representing different classes, acting as a staple of casual and competitive gaming for Steam. Dozens of different maps and game modes are trying to keep this game alive, after all the years it was available. Each character has a vast arsenal that can be accessed through completing in-game achievements, randomly receiving them from loot-boxes within the game, crafting them or just buying and trading items on the Steam Market. \r\nFor players, that's not into the direct clash with players from the enemy team, Team Fortress 2 introduced a PvE mode, which is wave defense from the mirrored robotic opponents that have qualities of some of the playable classes. \r\nEvery update and introduction, made over years, provided a lot of entertainment In the form of comic books an short animated videos, creating and explaining a story behind endless clashes for resources, briefcases or pure domination.",

It’s ’80s after all!\nTHE HUMOR THAT YOUR MOM WOULDN'T APPROVEBe sarcastic. Be gloom. Be whatever you want. There are thousands of things in this world you can laugh at, and even more you shouldn’t, but who cares. It’s jungle out there baby, and sometimes you just need something to release the stress.",

    "description": "The future holds many stories, and this one tells of a cyberpunk future within the Gemini system. Gemini Rue is a graphic adventure game that allows players to take control of two main characters. First is the Azriel Odin, who is an ex-assassin turned law enforcer, in order to gather information on his missing brother. Second – Delta-Six, a man with memories of his past life that finds himself in some kind of a rehabilitation facility for criminals, who will be allowed to leave after some needed training.\nGemini Rue is played like any other point-and-click adventure; where characters controlled by the player have to explore their environments through interactions with NPC’s and puzzle-solving. Additionally featured shooting mechanics, where players can aim and shoot from behind the cover. At set points in the game, players will be able to switch between characters, present in different world locations, going through these stories separately until they reach a common plot thread.",

    "description": "###The legacy\nThe original game was released for the Sega Genesis console with additional hardware that allowed the console from the late 80's to launch games on CD. From the point of view of gameplay, the game is not much different from other ones of the series of that time: it is a side-scrolling 2D platformer where the main goal of the player is to go as fast as possible. The game is often called the best in the series. In the development, it ought to be an improved version of the game Sonic The Hedgehog 2, but because of the low sales of the last, it was decided not to advertise connection between the two. Later the game was released on Sony PlayStation 2, Nintendo GameCube as part of the Sonic Gems Collection. The remastered version that uses a new engine was released for various platforms and mobile devices in 2011.\n\n###The plot\nThe plot of the game tells how Sonic goes to Never Lake, where the extraterrestrial body Little Planet appears at the end of the last month of each year. However, this time the main villain of the Sonic universe Dr. Robotnik tied the planet to the top of the mountain and began to transform its surface with the help of its robots into a huge factory. Sonic goes to the rescue to encounter not only Dr. Robotnik but also other characters in the series, such as Metal Sonic.\n\n###Key features\nThe gameplay of the game has not changed: Sonic must complete levels and defeat bosses at the end of each world. After collecting 50 rings, a special level becomes available, on which the player must destroy six UFOs. The version of the game for Steam includes the ability to play in 16: 9, leaderboards and a bunch achievements.",

    "description": "This is an intense strategy board game in a steampunk world of corrupt capitalist gremlins who compete for money, political power and prestige. Save and invest, steal and extort, arrest and get arrested – in single-player and multiplayer, with ranks and ladders, team mode and spectator mode. Featuring seasonal content updates, regular tournaments, item drops, full support of Steam Community Market – and more!\n\nHOW DO YOU PLAY THIS GAME?\nGremlins, Inc. is designed for up to 6 players, in multiplayer or in single-player mode (with AI bots). Each player has 6 cards on their hand (replenished from the same deck) and uses them either to move around the playing field or to perform different game actions. There is a lot of interaction with other players, and duels are significantly different from 3-player or 4-player games. You can play until a certain score limit, or until agreed number of rounds, or for time limit. The game offers both custom and ranked sessions (with matchmaking by rating).\n\nCAN YOU PLAY IN TEAMS OR JUST WATCH?\nYes, you can! In addition to custom sessions (where you define the parameters of the session and may optionally set filters for those who can join you) and password-protected private sessions (so that you and your friends can play undisturbed), the game offers team mode (2x2, 3x3, or 2x2x2) with teams of human players and/or AI bots. Gremlins, Inc. also supports a built-in spectator mode, which allows you to watch sessions of other players right from inside of the game, sharing your emotions with players and other spectators through messages and emoticons.\n\nCAN YOU PLAY THIS GAME OFFLINE?\nCertainly! When you buy this game, you get 2 products in your Steam Library: Gremlins, Inc. – the edition that is playable online in single-player and multiplayer modes, with full support of item drops and Steam Workshop; and Gremlins vs Automatons – the edition that is playable offline in single-player mode, without any connection to our server whatsoever.\n\nHOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO PLAY ONE SESSION?\nThe game offers different session settings to make them fit your available time, and single-player mode offers automatic SAVE / LOAD function at every turn so that you can take a break whenever you want (while multiplayer mode offers re-connect functionality as long as the session is still in progress). A quick duel for 20 score points with a fast timer can finish in under 20 minutes, while a 4-player session for 60 rounds can last for 2 hours or more.\n\nSHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM STRATEGIES?\nThere are different types of cards in the game (permanent, regular, secret and criminal) and as each card can be used either to move or for action, you will develop both short-term and long-term strategies for making the most out of where you are, and what you currently have in your hand. Normally, you spend half of your game time accumulating resources and building the foundation for the end-game, and the other half trying to control the progress of your opponents (stealing, arresting, initiating player conflicts, and so on). The more you play, the more new strategies you will discover – especially when combining the effects of several cards played in a combination.\n\nMAKE DECISIONS, PLAN YOUR MOVES\nThis is an intense strategy game: make decisions at every round! Plan your moves, then adjust to the actions of the other players and new cards drawn.The design of the playing field and the multiple layers of optional features (that you can turn on or off, as you wish) allow for a variety of strategies. The more you play, the more roads to victory you discover, using a combination of features based on the particular setup of the session.The game offers a diverse resource system that allows for many comeback chances even after you're robbed or arrested (or both). With score, money, votes, malice, income and bribes, the tension often remains until the very last round.The multilayer mode of the game features a system of ratings, ladders and ranked sessions: compete in a specific league, and take part in the regularly organised tournaments with over 1,000 participants. A system of anonymous masks allows everyone to compete on equal terms in a ranked session.Additionally, the game offers over 10 single-player challenges plus the option to create custom single-player sessions with different settings and a different mix of AI bots.Finally, there's the team mode where victory is determined not only by strategic skill, but also by communication and coordination of each team, which is an entirely different layer of game mechanics.\n\nFACTS & FIGURES\n179 cards in the main deck (143 of them – unique): permanent, regular, secret and criminal, each with a hand-drawn steampunk illustration; with each Season update, we keep adding several new cards to the deck.38 events in the Misfortune deck: these are the special events triggered at certain moments in the game, and may affect the current standing of all players to a significant degree, especially when used on a specific opponent.6 special Chaos Cards: this is an optional set of cards available to every player in the game; turn them on or off to change the dynamics of the session.12 sets of Character Abilities: another optional feature that brings to the game special game mechanics unique to each character type; playing with these makes different competing strategies even more pronounced.11 original locations: the Office, the Plant, the Dump, the Marketplace, the Inferno, the Jail, the Casino, the Court, the Treasure, the Bank and the Astral Plane; and 7 original spot types: Risk, Gamble, Police, Income, Bribe, Misfortune and Tribune.Finally, the game took us three years to develop from concept to full release, and we're still committed to continue supporting the community through development of new content. There are currently over 120,000 players of Gremlins, Inc. on Steam from all over the world, including USA, Russia, China, Japan, UK and France. Collectively, players launched over one million game sessions in the three months since its release.\n\nFINALLY, WHO ARE THE GREMLINS?\nYou think that’s just a pocket watch in your hand, a watch that’s a bit late because you keep forgetting to wind it up? No, no and no – you couldn’t be further from the truth! What you carry around is a whole gremlin town packed into this tiny mechanism: a town with its own bank, its own casino… and even its own jail! Gremlins are the microscopic creatures that inhabit any mechanism that they can possibly infiltrate. If a watch or a telescope malfunctions, then it’s probably due to gremlins who took up a residence there.\n\nMore than anything in life, gremlins value money, political power and prestige: prestige that one can claim after completing some sort of a grandiose engineering project. Aside from working on their own projects, gremlins mostly spend their time preventing other gremlins from building something even more grandiose. This they achieve through bribing officials and lying to the electorate, as well through stealing from their competitors - and outright arresting them.\n\nA DISCLAIMER (JUST IN CASE)\nWe felt it important to note that Gremlins, Inc. is not a free-to-play game. Also, this is not a CCG or TCG: you do not need to buy boosters or packs; in every session the game offers the same deck to every player, and everyone's chances are equal.\n\nOUR DLC POLICY\nWe are committed to the principle of continuously updating the game with new features and new game content that come as regular updates, FREE to every owner of the product. At the same time, from time to time we release DLCs that feature fun cosmetic content. If you like it, you can support our efforts by your purchase. However, there is absolutely no pressure to own any of the DLCs in order to play the game or compete in the tournaments. Every player, whether they have DLCs or not, has access to the same game features and the same game mechanics.\n\nThe game also supports crafting: once you find a blueprint of a specific item, you can create as many such items as you wish, as long as you have the required number of charges (you get charges when you convert other in-game items that you do not want, or have multiple copies of). Finally, the game has its own Steam Item Store where we sell a very small number of unique items that influence the item meta-game (but they have no effect on the game mechanics).\n\nONLINE & OFFLINE VERSIONS\nGremlins, Inc. was designed as a digital board game with the multiplayer mode at its heart. However, this is not to say that we don't like single-player – we do, and there's a separate section with the single-player challenges as well as the mode where you can create any custom single-player session that you like! One of the products that you receive with this game, Gremlins, Inc., features both single-player and multiplayer modes, and requires that your game client is connected to both Steam and the game's server at all times – in order to support item drops, Steam Community Market and Steam Workshop. The other product that is included with the game, Gremlins vs Automatons, features single-player mode and is designed specifically to be played offline.\n\nAMSTERDAM AND SINGAPORE SERVERS\nThe game currently supports 2 separate servers: Amsterdam and Singapore. Players are able to check their ping value for each of these servers, and play on the server that is the most convenient. Each server has its own player ladder, statistics and player profiles. Most players choose Amsterdam, since ping to Amsterdam from anywhere in the world rarely exceeds 300. However, as we saw more and more players from the Asian region join the game, especially from China, we added the server in Singapore in order to be able to offer faster connection specifically to these players. We hope that this works well for every player, as good player experience is our top priority. We will continue to monitor the quality of our server/client connection in order to adapt the servers to the changing requirements and we thank you for your patience.",

    "description": "Initially released in 2005 for Microsoft Xbox and later ported to other platforms, the game is part of the Oddworld series. It is significantly different from other installments: here the player takes control over the bounty hunter named Stranger. He catches criminals and gets rewards for them. The final goal is to earn enough money for some mysterious medical operation.\n\nThe player travels with Stranger to four cities: Clakkerz; Gizzard Gulch, Buzzarton, and New Yolk City. One of the features of the game is the use of \"live\" ammo: insects and small mammals. All of them have different stats and are effective against different types of enemies.\n\nThe game uses two camera modes: from the first and the third person. Third-person perspective is used to solve platformer challenges while traveling long distances and in hand-to-hand combat. The game switches to the first person while using the sniper class weapons.",

    "description": "The Walking Dead: A New Frontier is the third episode of the storyline, based on a comic book series. \n\n###Plot \nThe events of the game take place in four years after the zombie virus hit the world. Clementine is an original character from the previous episodes.\nShe is still alive and trying to survive. She meets Javier Garcia. Javier’s family was taken from him, so he has to find them. Together they find out about the existence of the New Frontier. It is a group of survivors, whose credibility is ambiguous. \n\n###Gameplay \nLike two past seasons, the third one is a point-and-click adventure. However, in turn, there are two available characters.\nYou can play as a Javier, who was introduced only in this episode. The player can choose Clementine, but only in flashbacks. You control and direct your character around the environment, explore different scenery elements and pick up and keep objects. These objects can be used to advance the story later.\nMoreover, you can begin dialogues with non-player characters. Their answers can give a broad range of choices; it even includes staying silent. The time for making a selection is limited. However, even if the player does not make it, the conversation is not stopping. In this case, it is regarded as you stayed silent. These choices have an impact on later events. There are more action-oriented scenes, where you have to make quick decisions. If you fail it, you would have to restart from the very beginning of the scene.",

    "description": "Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands is an action-adventure third-person game developed by Ubisoft Montreal. It is the direct sequel to Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones.\r\n\r\n###Plot\r\nThe Prince decides to visit the kingdom of his elder brother Malik to train in martial arts. Upon the Prince's arrival, the kingdom is found to be under a siege. Trying to repel the invaders, Malik uses an ancient mystic medallion that frees the ancient army of Solomon. Upon breaking free, the army turns the people of the kingdom into sand statues. Only the Prince of Persia can stop the army from destroying the kingdom.\r\n\r\n###Gameplay\r\nThe game uses the usual Action-adventure formula where the player-controlled character traverses the level while avoiding traps, solves puzzles, and fights enemies using aerobatics and special powers. The game features a complex fighting system. \r\n\r\nAs the game progresses, the Prince learns more and more skills. The player is able to control all four nature elements: fire, earth, water, and air. Using such power, it is easy to manipulate the game's environment. It is essential to combine magic skills with the fighting system in order to be most efficient in the game.\r\n\r\nAs in previous games of the series, it is possible to rewind time. If the player makes a mistake and the Prince dies, the player can travel several seconds back into the gameplay. If such a thing is impossible, the player has to restart from the latest checkpoint.",

    "description": "Trine is a mystical artifact that at some point in the past chose three mighty heroes to make sure that the land would be safe and the balance would be restored in time. Brave Knight Pontius, agile Thief Zoya and Amadeus the Wizard are called again to find out the source of the disturbance. \n\nAfter the events of the second game, all three heroes had their time to rest, but now, after they answered a new call, the prisoner of the Artifacts, Sarek, has broken out and is planning to corrupt the world with his magic.\n\nStudio Frozenbyte continued the story of the games while adding new mechanics. They expanded the game camera, and now players can experience bright and detailed backgrounds of the game and even move with the camera behind their back because Trine 3 is a full 3D game. The game studio had to cut the game short, ending the game on a cliffhanger, because the full scope of the project went outside of their budget, and it was the only way for them to finish the game. The rich soundtrack helps to add the atmosphere to the world of magic and whimsy.",

    "description": "Edge is an isometric puzzle platformer. You control a cube and need to lead it through levels to the goal, collecting light prisms and trying not to fall off the map. You see the map from the isometric perspective, and the cube moves diagonally. There are 45 main and 3 unlockable levels in the game. \n\nThe key feature of the gameplay is the ability of the cube to balance at the certain angle. You need this to complete the most difficult parts of the route. When rolling is not enough, you can climb a moving block to overcome an obstacle or perform any other maneuver. However, these tricks are not easy to master.\n\nHowever, Edge challenges your reflexes more than your ability to solve puzzles. The game usually gives direct hints about where to go and what to do to pass the level but it’s quite difficult to perform this safely. Problems can appear only with collecting all the prisms as they can be hidden. In general, the entire game is created in simple polygonal style so nothing distracts you from completing levels.",

    "description": "Armello is a digital role-playing tabletop game developed by an indie Australian studios League of Geeks. It is the debut project of the game.\n\n###Plot\nThe game is set in a “dark fairytale” kingdom of Armello, where the anthropomorphic animals from many clans live. The king has gone crazy and is slowly dying because of the dark force named the Rot. The representatives of several factions come to the kingdom's capital to become the new king. Four characters are present at the beginning of the game: Tane the wolf, Amber the rabbit, Mercurio the rat, and Sanah, the bear. \n\n###Gameplay\nArmello is a digital remake of a traditional fantasy tabletop role-playing game in which there are rolling dice and cards, that allows the players to execute certain actions. The gaming area is divided into hexagonal plates, that contain procedurally generated features like caves, buildings, other characters or pieces of equipment. As the game progresses, the players can buy in-game currency to purchase special abilities using the skill tree, that is unique to every character.\n\nThe game uses a turn-based system, where the players can equip new items or acquire new skills while the other players make their turn. The cards and dice are used only when the players directly interact with the in-game world. The players use cards for casting spells, hiring teammates, treating wounds or using the special items that grant temporary abilities.",

    "description": "Motorsport by its very nature is dangerous. DiRT 4 is all about embracing that danger. It’s about the thrill, exhilaration and adrenaline that is absolutely vital to off-road racing. And more than that, it’s about loving that feeling. It’s about pushing flat out next to a sheer cliff drop. Going for the gap that’s slightly too small. Seeing how much air you can get in a truck. They call it ‘being fearless’.\nDiRT 4 also features a game-changing system called Your Stage; an innovative rally route creation tool that allows you to produce an almost-infinite number of unique stages at the press of a button. You choose your location and set the route parameters, then Your Stage does the hard work to create a unique rally stage that you can race, share with your friends and then challenge them to beat your time. Your Stage allows experienced rally players to create longer, more technical routes, whilst newcomers can create simpler shorter routes as they hone their skills.\nWith DiRT 4, Codemasters have sought to bring the levels of thrill from last year’s DiRT Rally with the fearless excitement, accessibility and adrenaline-fueled races previously seen in its critically acclaimed prequels DiRT 2 and DiRT 3.\nFeaturing classic rally racing that continues to build on the foundations set by the Colin McRae Rally games, the bruising contests from the official FIA World Rallycross Championship, the crazy battles of racing trucks and buggies, and the outrageous fun of open events in Joyride, players will face challenges from locations that span three continents.\n• OVER 50 OF THE MOST BREATH-TAKING OFF-ROAD CARS EVER BUILT – Including Ford Fiesta R5, Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution VI, Subaru WRX STI NR4 and Audi Sport quattro S1 E2\n• 5 INCREDIBLE RALLY LOCATIONS WITH MILLIONS OF ROUTES – Australia, Spain, Michigan, Sweden & Wales\n• THE OFFICIAL GAME OF THE FIA WORLD RALLYCROSS CHAMPIONSHIP – Race at Montalegre, Lohéac Bretagne, Hell, Holjes & Lydden Hill in a multitude of different series\n• LANDRUSH – Short-course dirt track racing in Pro Buggies, Pro-2 Trucks, Pro-4 Trucks and Crosskart vehicles in California, Nevada and Mexico\n• JOYRIDE - Laptime challenges, smash challenges, free-play area and send challenges to friends\n• DiRT ACADEMY – Taking place at the DirtFish Rally School in Washington, USA, learn the skills, techniques and practice to become the best!\n• CAREER MODE – create your driver, compete across the disciplines, gain sponsors and build your team with clear goals and rewards\n• COMPETITIVE GAMING – Daily, weekly and month-long challenges against fellow players from around the world\n• NEXT GENERATION OF RACENET – Live ladder, leagues and tournaments, cross-platform leaderboards, enhanced CREST telemetry system\n• TUNING – Tweak your set-up based on vehicle, track and weather conditions to best suit your racing style\n• DAMAGE & REPAIRS – Wear and tear is faithfully recreated with an improved and realistic damage model. Damage can be repaired by hiring Engineers to work in the team’s Service Area between stages but with a finite amount of time available.",

    "description": "Mother Russia Bleeds is an independent beat 'em up title developed by Le Cartel Studio.\n\n###Plot\nThe game is set in an alternate version of USSR in the eighties. The government cannot do anything with widespread crime, so it simply ignores that. Four street fighters from a gypsy community unwillingly become the test subjects for a new drug called Necro. After escaping from the laboratory, the main character returns back to their community only to find it in ruins and the whole population becoming drug addicts. The protagonist becomes eager to get revenge on those, who did that. Further into the game, the main character starts taking Necro themselves, which causes horrible hallucinations.\n\n###Gameplay\nMother Russia Bleeds is a beat 'em up game which is largely inspired by titles such as Streets of Rage and Double Dragon.\n\nThe players advance through a level, that is divided into multiple sections. In progress further, the players have to kill every enemy they encounter in a section. At the end of each level, a boss fight is held.\n\nApart from hand-to-hand combat, the players can use the world's items, such as pipes, knives, bottles, and pistols. One of the defining features of the game is the health regeneration system, as the players can pump Necro out of their enemies corpses and eject them to themselves. A choice is given - regenerate health or become a berserk that has much more strength and speed.\n\nThe game can either be completed solo or in a four-player co-op.",

    "description": "Torment: Tides of Numenera is a role-playing game developed by inXile Entertainment in 2017. \n\n###Plot \nThe action takes place in a fantasy setting, a distant future representation called Numenera. The current age of the action is called the Ninth World, as the characters believe it to be the successor of the past civilizations. The protagonist is the Last Castoff, an ancient man who left his physical body to reborn in a new one. He is a creation of the so-called Changing God. His actions attract the Sorrow, the antipode who tries to destroy the protagonist and other God’s creations. To survive, the Last Castoff has to find his creator. The player aims to explore the Ninth World, find other creatures and confront the Sorrow. \n\n###Gameplay \nThe player act from the Last Castoff perspective. He has the opportunity to perform in different ways; either peacefully – making arrangements with other characters, or hostilely – fighting with enemies and using power to negotiate. The setting is performed in the isometric perspective, and every performance is supported by the theme music and dialogues between the characters. \n\n###Key features \nTorment: Tides of Numenera is believed to be another game’s spiritual successor. It is called Planescape: Torment which was developed in 1999. Just like in its predecessor, Torment places emphasis on the story rather than on combat or item accumulation.",

    "description": "###Turing puzzle\nThe Turing Test is a first-person puzzle game for one on the Unreal Engine 4. The game was developed by the Bulkhead Interactive studio, and published by Square Enix. The game for a long time was an exclusive for Windows and Xbox where it was released on August 30, 2016. It came on the PS4 only in January 2017.\n\n###The story\nIn the game, the player will take control over the main character - Ava Turing, who is an engineer at the space station. Artificial intelligence awakens her from cryogenic sleep since the team didn’t answer for 450 hours. It was sent with a research mission to Europe - a Jupiter’s satellite. Now Ava as the responsible employee is obliged to sit down in the transport module and find out what happened and why the team is silent.\n\n###Turing test\nUpon arrival at the station, it turns out that its structure has been changed and to achieve at least some results - it will be necessary to solve puzzles while communicating with Tom - the AI that was left at the disposal of Ave. The player has to reconstruct the picture of the events that happened here by the bit by finding information. The game takes inspiration from the real Turing Test. The Turing test is a real test that the scientist Alan Turing suggested. In the course of it, a person should communicate with somebody without seeing him. During such a conversation, a person should understand with whom he is talking - with another person or with a robot.",

    "description": "In Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime, the player assumes control over the crew of a pixelated spaceship. Your goal is to navigate it through the dangerous 2D space, avoid asteroids and fight off enemy ships and space monsters. Every time the ship hits an object, it loses some of its health. \nThe spaceship contains several devices, such as thrusters, laser cannons, and deflector shields, and one character can only control one device at a time. To keep the ship running and safe, the protagonists have to constantly move around the ship to activate a certain device. This is why, although Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime can also be played alone, the game is strongly oriented towards the cooperative multiplayer. Up to four players can participate and form a crew to thoroughly control every device. Even in the single-player mode, there’s the second protagonist, presumably your character's lover, who is controlled by the AI and obeys your orders. \nPink-colored surfaces, gigantic hearts that need to be unchained, and other visual elements highlight the game’s underlying theme of love as the means to survive. The game’s visuals are colorful, albeit simple, and are based on the “superflat” art style.",

    "description": "LUFTRAUSERS is a shoot 'em up game developed by Vlambeer. It is a remake of an earlier game of the same name by Vlambeer made on Flash.\n\nLUFTRAUSERS is an arcade two-dimensional plane sim that uses retro pixelated style. The player controls a plane that somewhat reminds a vehicle developed in the German V-Waffen (retaliatory weapons) project. The plane's main weapon can shoot only in the direction of flying so the players need some skill shooting and flying at the same time. Further into the game upgrades for the plane are unlocked, such as new weapons, body kits, and engines. There is 125 plane builds available in the game. The build the player uses affects the music player in the game. Every plane subsystem brings something new into the game's music. \n\nThe main objective of the player is to survive against the enemies overwhelming force, which includes reactive and experimental planes, zeppelins, boats, ships, subs and so on. A scoring system is also present in the game. Upon the enemies destruction, the player gains a score multiplier.",

    "description": "Worms Revolution is a Team17 game and the 18th part of Worms series, counting as many as 25 titles total. It is the turn-based game with a heavy accent on customizable characters and environment. The game features single- and multiplayer while giving the players an opportunity to play in cooperative with the hotseat feature allowing them to take turns one at a time.\nIt is hard to say that \"Worms\" has any plot at all: there is barely even hints, which may prompt the player to understand the eternal conflict between the worms of a different color. \nThe gameplay, on the other hand, is quite memorable: in fact so crucial that not only Worms have given birth to many other worms-like games but also created a whole genre: artillery tactical turn-based strategy. The primary goal of a team or a player is to eliminate the opponent(s). To achieve this goal, one must utilize a various range of weapons. They do not only damage the other worms but also transform the ground. While every turn grants the player with the ability to walk a certain amount of space and utilize one weapon — the landscape factor is crucial here.",

    "description": "Counter-Strike is a multiplayer phenomenon in its simplicity. No complicated narratives to explain the source of the conflict, no futuristic and alien threats, but counter-terrorists against terrorists. Arena shooter at its core, CS:GO provides you with various methods of disposing enemies and reliant on cooperation within the team. During the round of the classical clash mode, you will gradually receive currency to purchase different equipment. Each player can carry a primary weapon, secondary pistol, knife and a set of grenades, which all can change the battle if wielded by the skilled player. \r\nObjectives are clear and vary from map to map, from game mode to game mode. Stop the terrorists from planting explosives, stop the counter-terrorist from retrieving the hostages, kill everyone who isn’t you and just perform the best with.\r\nCS:GO is one of the major cybersport discipline, which makes playing it more exciting to some players. Aside from purchasing the game, CS:GO is infamous for its loot case system, that requires players to purchase keys, in order to open said cases. Customization items consist of weapon skins, weapon stickers, and sprays that do not affect gameplay and have purely visual value to the player.",

    "description": "The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing: Final Cut is a role-playing game with several hack and slash elements developed by NeocoreGames. It is a remastered version of the trilogy of games by the same name. \n\n###Setting\nBased on Bram Stoker's Dracula, the game is set in the alternative 19th century Europe. The world bears some steampunk inspired details and is described as full of monsters, magic, and weird technologies. You play as the some of Abraham Van Helsing, a legendary vampire hunter from Stoker's novel. He sets on the same path his father once did.\n\n###Gameplay\nThe main objective of the game is to clear the in-game world of monsters. Experience is gained from killing monsters and is used for leveling up. With each new level, it is possible to improve Van Helsing's firearms or melee weapons. Van Helsing can also improve his own stats after leveling up. Four stats are present in the game: body build, agility, willpower, and luck. \n\nThe game features an inventory system which allows for the players to upgrade their armor, coat and the amulet the protagonist carries with himself. Money is gained by either completing quests or selling the items you do not need to the shopkeepers.\n\nThe main character is accompanied by the ghost of a woman that his father once saved. She helps Van Helsing in conversations with other characters and during combat. The players can order her to stay passive or become more aggressive. She has her own inventory and stats.",

Seven different characters decide to go into the cave to learn something about themselves and who they might become.",

    "description": "\"Sony exclusives are mostly story driven experiences and Unfinished Swan is no exception. It’s a first-person adventure game about a young boy named Monroe, who recently lost his mother, famous artist known for not finishing a painting, adding up to the number of her incomplete works. And out of all her works, Monroe is permitted to keep only one favorite, a swan with a missing neck. And one night he wakes up to see the swan escape, and after the short chase players will find themselves in a painted unfinished world, finding the missing swan.\nOver the course of the game, players will use a magic silver brush to spread the black paint over the blank and completely white environment, to locate a way to progress and solutions to puzzles, while the narrator tells a story of a Lonely King. Most of the environments and the painting tool are used to show players, that Unfinished Swan is more of a narrative experience, where puzzles are not stopping your progress entirely, but act as an obstacle. There is no active combat in the game, so the actions of the player will wholly dictate the pace and completion.",

    "description": "Final Fantasy XIII-2 is a Japanese role-playing game, a direct sequel to 2009 title Final Fantasy XIII and the third installment in Fabula Nova Crystallis subseries. \n\n###Plot \nThe game takes place three years after the event of the original game. Final Fantasy XIII’s main character Lightning, appears only as a supporting character, while the story follows her sister, Serah Farron, and a new character Noel Kreiss. \n\n###Gameplay \nThe gameplay is almost identical to that of the original game. The battle system is presented as Command Synergy Battle. It is based on usage of Action Time Battle bar: the bar consists of several slots that are used to perform attacks or cast spells and gradually refills during the battle. \nHowever, the game has some significant differences compared to the original game. The areas are more opened and endorse exploration. The party consists only of two characters, while the third spot is reserved for tamed monsters. The game also uses a random encounter system from previous installments.\n\n###Plot \nThe storyline follows the events of the XIII. They, however, do not connect to the other Final Fantasies so any chapter of the series may be played in unspecified order. The protagonists of the game are six youngsters who are trying to prevent the end of the world.",

    "description": "Ticket to Ride is a turn-based strategy game, an adaptation of a board game of the same name. \n\n### Gameplay  \nThe gameplay copies the board game entirely. The game takes place on a map of the United States and south Canada filled with multicolored railroads.\nEach player starts with 45 train pieces and has to choose two Destination Cards. The Destination Ticket cards show two cities that player has to connect. Each turn every player chooses one of three actions: spend their train pieces to claim part of the railroad, draw three more destination tickets and keep at least one of them and draw two railway car cards. You can only claim railroad parts if you have enough railway car cards that match the road’s color. The amount of train pieces you spend depends on the length of the railroad fragment. \nClaiming routes and connecting cities on your Destination Ticket card give you points at the end of the game. However, incomplete tickets make you lose points. The player with the most points wins the match. \n\n### Downloadable content  \nTicket to Ride features several DLCs in the form of extra maps. Europe and 1910 USA maps were released in 2008 for Xbox 360 version of the game. These maps appeared later in the Mac and PC versions of the game alongside the Switzerland and Legendary Asia maps.",

    "description": "Lead your motorcycle gang on an epic journey across the country in this brutal driving combat adventure.\nEarn money by completing races, assassinations, robberies, and other challenges in your path.   As you collect loot, you'll upgrade your character, your bike, and your weapons.\nOne Life To Live\nDriving a motorcycle at 100 mph while trying to hit someone with a pipe is dangerous, and death can come quickly.   Fortunately, every time you die, all the experience you've collected can be used to upgrade your character, your bike, and your weapons.\nIn the multiplayer mode, you can work with your friends or let out some road rage on them.  It's up to you.\nA Truly Epic Quest\nRoad Redemption takes place in a post-apocalyptic America, ruled by a brutal dictator.  Fans of Mad Max will feel right at home here.\nAfter years of bloody street warfare, the country's biker gangs have settled into an uneasy truce.\nThis period of peace is interrupted when the leader of the country's richest weapons cartel is assassinated, and a $15,000,000 bounty is put on the mysterious assassin's head.\nIt's up to you and your fellow gang members to chase down the assassin and claim this prize, but you'll have to drive through unfriendly territory to do so.  Every biker in the country wants a piece of that $15,000,000 bounty, and they won't hesitate to take out those who get in their way.\nOther Features\nSingle player campaign fully playable in multiplayer mode.\nTons of brutal weapons.  This is more Twisted Metal than it is Mario Kart\n4-player splitscreen co-op.\nOnline mode coming very soon.\nMassive, expandable skill tree. Rack in the loot to upgrade your character, your bike, and your weapons.\nA deep motorcycle fighting system with grabs, kicks, counters, critical strikes, and more.\nFull support for both mouse & keyboard and gamepad control configurations.",

    "description": "Cook, Serve, Delicious is a hardcore restaurant sim, one of the few in its genre that gives the players total control over where they want to take their restaurant.\n\nThe game centers on an old, worn down restaurant in the SherriSoda Tower, which was once the heart of the building but closed down as business (and tenants) dropped to an all time low. But with the local economy rising back up and occupancy reaching its maximum, SherriSoda Tower has decided to bring back the old Cook, Serve, Delicious restaurant, and has given you complete control to bring it back to its old five star status of world class dining.\n\nTo do that, you’ll start with a few thousand dollars and thirty foods to choose from to put on your menu, as well as a host of restaurant equipment and more. Nearly everything is unlocked from the start of the game for you to purchase; this is your restaurant, and you must figure out the best strategy to get that restaurant packed with satisfied customers. Can you prove your culinary skills?\n\nAnd if that weren’t enough, you’ll also have the opportunity to be cast in the Iron Cook television show, throw parties for offices in SherriSoda Tower, read virtual mail in your SherriSoda Tower Email account which ranges from game tips to crazy spam (nearly 500 emails in all), from customers providing feedback to your restaurant to opportunities such as being able to fund projects via “ClicknStart” and other big surprises!\n\nThe game draws a lot of inspiration from the original PlayStation game Ore no Ryouri. Cook, Serve, Delicious! was initially a free game that used hand-drawn graphics in its gameplay. The game's author David Galindo wanted to make a sequel for that game, but he had no funds to do so. After publishing his first attempt at releasing a full-scale game, Galindo earned some money that would be used for the development of Cook, Serve, Delicious!\n\nWith hours of content and tons of secrets and unlockables, Cook, Serve, Delicious will provide a big challenge for anyone who’s ready to take their crumbling, rat infested eatery to a luxurious Platinum Star Restaurant. Good luck!",

    "description": "The gang is back, and they have bigger and better plans. Objective based cooperative FPS became more complicated. The classic group of Hoxton, Dallas, Chains and Wolf got reinforcement, and now Payday Gang consists of 21 heisters, some of which are based on movie characters or even Youtubers. Players will be able to customize their own private arsenal, their masks, and skills, to complete the missions in their own way, be it stealthy sneak-in or full frontal assault. After completing missions, players will receive EXP points, money and a chance to get a special item that can be a gun modification, mask or a safe containing weapon skins.\r\nPayday 2 is a multiplayer game, meaning, that even during offline missions players will be followed by AI characters, whose loadouts, masks and perks can be customized as well. This game has been supported by the developers for many years, and amount of DLC speaks plenty of their dedication to the player base.",

    "description": "Rock of Ages is a game which resembles a racing game, a Tower Defence and a platformer at the same time. It was developed by ACE Team.\n\nThe game is loosely based on the myth of Sisyphus. The main objective of the player is to use a giant boulder in order to destroy the enemy castle located at the bottom of the hill while at the same time defending your own stronghold using various structures. Players can build money farms to raise the funds necessary to build defensive structures or upgrade the boulder itself. After gathering a certain amount of money it is possible to equip both defensive and offensive upgrades to the boulder. The enemies can destroy the boulder in which case the player has to wait until the boulder spawns again and proceed with the offense. The player wins if they successfully destroy the enemy's castle gates and place the boulder right in the center of the castle. \n\nThere are five distinctive time periods present in the game, such as romanticism, rococo, renaissance, and so on.",

    "description": "The genre of this game is defined as stealth-action. However, its plot is very unusual, although it does not contradict such a definition of the genre.\n\n###Plot\nYour character is a person who is deadly tired of a very common problem: the neighbors who threw a noisy party, not taking into account that they do not live alone in the world.\n\nIn ordinary life, you usually silently endure or call the police. But in this game you should just kill everyone who has the imprudence to make noise. You can do it with a knife, and you can use other, very simple, improvised means. At first, you only have a knife, but over time, the tools appear more interesting.\n\n###Gameplay\nThe game has ten unique levels. Some details of each level are generated randomly, so each game is somewhat different from the other.\n\nAfter loading the level of the hero finds himself standing in front of a building or a complex of buildings, where there is a party with the participation of about fifty people.\n\nIt is assumed that by this time your character is already quite angry. And now he faces only one simple task - to destroy all.\n\nThe character has the skills to work with a knife, can set a variety of different traps, use various items.\n\nThere are also obstacles in the game. For example, party members may call the police, there are guards in the building, and if you kill a police officer, FBI agents will arrive. There are also others who may suddenly appear.\n\n###Bonuses\nYour character is not always the same person. There are several characters in the game that you can become as you play. These characters are more capable of killing, among them there are ninja and even a policeman.\n\nYou may have allies, someone you can call for help.\n\nThere is also a spin-off simulation game titled Party Hard Tycoon.",

The environment and tracks are inspired by real locations in different parts of the planet. Also, there is an opportunity to generate dynamic weather conditions (rain, snow, fog, as well as day or night).\n\nThere are three main in-game modes: tour, single event and multiplayer. In the tour, the player is given the opportunity to complete individual tests with a specific set of purposes and with particular test cars. In the check-in mode, one of three additional modes can be chosen: drift, race and time race.\n\nThe game has a vast diversity of cars (in total 50 models), the auto park updates each time with the appearance of patches.",

    "description": "The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing II is an action-RPG game, a second installment in the series set in a fictional universe.\n\n###Plot and setting\nThe game’s story picks up after its predecessor, continuing the legacy of a legendary vampire hunter’s son set out on different quests, with the ultimate goal of protecting humankind from various monsters. As well as the first game, Van Helsing II is based on different gothic fantasy tales, with elements from Stoker’s Dracula as the main source of influence. However, despite the grim setting, the series offers comic relief elements through dialogues, NPCs and many more references.\n\n###Gameplay\nRegarding game mechanics, The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing follow the steps of the genre’s progenitor, Diablo, with hordes of enemies to combat with, various classes for the main character, large, and different loot. The new elements in the second part of the series are various interactions with the rebels, where the protagonist can train and assemble task teams and send them out on different side quests. \n\n###Graphical elements and other features\nThe game engine is shared between both installments of the series; however, the second game brings out smoothened textures, corners, and almost every detail, making slight improvements while staying true to the steampunk setting and overall tone. The game also offers a cooperative multiplayer campaign, and a competitive multiplayer mode, where up to 8 players can engage in PvP battles.",

    "description": "A famous series of fighting games, that for a long time, remained an exclusive for consoles. In 2013, the game got a reboot on the Xbox One, and in 2017 the game moved to the PC.\r\n\r\nKiller Instinct of 2017 is all the same one on one melee fights. The developers got inspiration from other legendary games in the genre: attack set was borrowed from Street Fighter series and finishing moves from Mortal Kombat. In the reboot, the Combo Breaker mechanic has been changed a little - now it is necessary to coincide in strength and timing with a counter blow to make a successful break. The plot of the game almost wholly repeats the plot of the first part: each fighter passes the way in a tournament organized by a mega-corporation and fights with the final Fulgore boss. The details of the story are different for each character.\r\n\r\nYou can fight for 20 stages with a dynamically changing environment and destructibility. Besides, the game has all the fighters from the previous parts. The plot campaign with cinematic cut scenes will have to be done alone. With other players, you can compete in online multiplayer, with the online ranking system. To play on a PC, the developers advise using a controller.",

    "description": "Comedic action role-playing games have a certain public to appease and The Bard’s Tale, a separate title from the series with a similar name, succeeds. Players control the Bard, a cynical, sarcastic opportunist in the world of magic and swords. He is not interested in saving the world, but when it comes to getting a reward, or his own head is on the line – he’ll gladly jump into the action. And when the cult members recruited him to save the Caleigh, a beautiful princess, he considers that it might be worth his time.\nThe Bard’s Tale (2004) was a deviation from the main series, not only with a 3D environments but a moral choice system. The Bard has a choice in almost every dialogue to give either snarky or nice response, which might have lasting consequences through the entirety of the game. The game introduces summoning mechanic, which is improved with every musical instrument Bard finds during the story that allows players to call for the help of a companion. Companion specialty varied and they might be attacking defensive or utility. And because the game is focused on a musician, the player will view many musical numbers and songs.",

    "description": "Welcome to your new summer job at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, where kids and parents alike come for entertainment and food as far as the eye can see! The main attraction is Freddy Fazbear, of course; and his two friends. They are animatronic robots, programmed to please the crowds! The robots' behavior has become somewhat unpredictable at night however, and it was much cheaper to hire you as a security guard than to find a repairman.\nFrom your small office you must watch the security cameras carefully. You have a very limited amount of electricity that you're allowed to use per night (corporate budget cuts, you know). That means when you run out of power for the night- no more security doors and no more lights! If something isn't right- namely if Freddybear or his friends aren't in their proper places, you must find them on the monitors and protect yourself if needed!\nCan you survive five nights at Freddy's?\n\"For all the simplicity of the game’s controls and premise, Five Nights at Freddy‘s is frightening. It’s a fantastic example of how cleverness in design and subtlety can be used to make an experience terrifying. Simple still images and proper character design steal the show in this game, and show that Scott Cawthon knows quite a lot about the secret fears people feel when looking at creepy dolls and toys. It’s elegant in how it sows fear, and is a must-own for anyone who likes scary games.\" -Joel Couture IndieGameMag.com\nThis game was created using Clickteam Fusion!",

    "description": "Gods Will Be Watching is a point-and-click survival thriller. Deconstructeam have developed it, and it is the only title within the IP. The game was incipiently created within the Ludum Dare development competition, the theme of which was minimalism. That gradually affected the style of a final game build.\nThe story centers around the group of survivors questioned with a quest to survive during the 40 days being cut off from the outside world. The game's core feature is the variety of moral decision — the player decides who is worthy of sacrificing for the sake of the group's survival.\nThe gameplay features walking and talking with the other characters — six in total — while a heavy accent is made on time- and resource management. The game's name derives from the absence of right and wrong decisions: not only the survival of the team is a task at hand but the survival of an outside world from genocide.",

    "description": "###Three in a row\nThe third part of the popular series of games in the genre three in a row, Bejeweled 3 was developed by the PopCap Games studio in 2010. The game was the fifth in the series, but the third one that received a number in the name. Originally released only on PC and Mac, but later it was ported to both consoles and mobile devices running Android, iOS, Java ME and Windows Phone. The developers called the game “the biggest Bejeweled experience available to date.” The game is available for free at partner sites.\n\n###What to do?\nThe goal of the game has not changed compared to the previous parts: the player must match three identical in color gem, which, if all is correct, they disappear. Rows of gems are constantly moving, and the game adds the random new gems on top screen. Thus, the player can launch a chain reaction and earn many points at once.\n\n###What’s new?\nIn the new part of Bejeweled, four new game modes appeared as well as new sound effects and improved graphics. However, this is true not for all versions of the game: so in the Java ME version, players have only four game modes available due to hardware limitations. There is Zen mode also in the game - a new one. There, players can customize the audio and visual components of the game and create their own meditative experience. There is no plot in the game, but you can earn 65 badges to prove the ultimate player’s skill.",

After waking up in the middle of the night to mysterious sounds, you start exploring the dark looking for comfort.\nThe game explores horror through atmosphere and exploration, not with scores and combat systems. In Among the Sleep you’re vulnerable, scared, and trying to make sense of the world.\nController support: Works 100% with Xbox 360 controllers, might have some issues with Xbox One controllers. We are sorry about the inconvience.\nThe game will not get VR support.What people are saying\n\"More, please!\"\n- Kotaku\n\"[...] it more than succeeds in creating a wonderfully eerie atmosphere full of childlike anxiety, and along the way tackles a serious subject in a darkly poignant manner.\"\n- IGN\n\"Its depiction of a first-person horror told through the eyes and stumbling little legs of a two-year old is as intriguing as anything I've seen all year, and reminiscent of a time when games actively sought out new ways to play and new stories to tell.\"\n- Eurogamer",

    "description": "Essentially a tech demo, “Half-Life 2: Lost Coast” sole purpose was to show off the new high-dynamic-range-rendering of the Source engine, it was a welcome addition to the franchise. It’s a free addition to the game that can be downloaded through Steam by the owners of Half-Life 2. Gordon Freeman founds himself near a group of decaying piers, fully armed and ready to explore the monastery above him, fighting through the Combine forces.\nHigh-dynamic-range-rendering introduced realistic lighting effects to the game, emulating even camera’s overexposure to the bright light, which was eventually moved to the main game. Lost Coast story is conveyed without cutscenes, every part of the level is tailored specifically to demonstrate the changes, made by developers. Even though it was originally created for the Half-Life 2, it was removed from the main game, alongside some minor story details. It’s not a full standalone game and wasn’t intended as one.",

    "description": "FIFA 14 is a football simulation video game which was released on multiple platforms in 2013. Also, it was one of the first game to be released on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. These versions of FIFA 14 feature a new game engine Ignite. This engine features both graphical and gameplay enchantments. The game also features an improved AI mechanic which created a much more realistic game of football with every player in the stadium being as much realistic as possible. But not only, the players became more realistic as the weather effects became more believable too as well as the crowd which responds in anything that happens on the stadium. \r\n\r\nFIFA 14 offers 33 fully licensed leagues, over 600 different football clubs with over 16,000 players, also 47 fully licensed international teams and legend teams.  \r\nThe famous mod of FIFA 10 called FIFA Ultimate team also returns. It allows players to build their own team from real players and staff with which players can compete both in online and offline tournaments.",

    "description": "The Escapists is an indie adventure game with role-playing and puzzle elements developed by Mouldy Toof Studios.\n\n###Gameplay\nYou play as a prisoner with only one goal in mind - escape. The players can acquire items that will help them in the process of escaping either by buying them from fellow prisoners or crafting them. In fact, you can always steal the items you need from someone else.\n\nIt is possible to interact with other inmates who can assign tasks to the player. By completing these quests, the players can increase their respect or earn some money. Different activities such as visiting the gym or reading in the library increase the player's stats which increase the chances of a successful escape. \n\nIn order for the player to not be spotted by their wardens, it is essential to avoid their attention and follow the timetable by eating food with all the other inmates, appearing at a morning gathering, and so on. The cells are often searched, so the player has to be careful and hide the tools required for the escape. If one should get detected, they're moved to the punishment cell and lose all the items and preparations they made for the escape.\n\n###Miscellanious\nFive add-ons for the game were released. Each of them added new prisons, including the iconic Alcatraz prison, new escape options, crafts and much more.",

In the far future the Orokin had absolute control over the solar system but have since disappeared, now the militaristic Grineer, the money-worshipping Corpus, and the Infested fight for what they left behind. You are a Tenno - a master of gun and blade and user of the Warframes, it is up to you to bring back balance to the system from within, while also fighting a new threat from without: the Sentients.\r\nOver 40 unique Warframes to build, hundreds of guns and melee weapons to utilize, and various pet companions to help you along the way - all of which can be crafted for free and enhanced by an in-depth modding system.\r\nWith constant updates by Digital Extremes, the game now has over six years of updates including new open-world landscapes (Plains of Eidolon-2017, Orb Vallis-2018) and cinematic story expansions (The Second Dream-2015, The War Within-2016, The The Sacrifice-2018) with more content being added every year.",

    "description": "I Am Alive is an action game with survival elements set in the post-apocalyptic environment. You take on the role of Adam, who lost his wife and daughter during the earthquake in Chicago. Almost a year after the accident he starts looking for them around the semi-destroyed city.\n\nLike many survival games, I Am Alive includes resource management, crafting and fighting with other survivors over the loot. The unique parameter you need to take into account is Adam’s stamina: every action reduces his powers. The game provides an extensive combat system that features several weapon types and protection items along with the ability to frighten some enemies and to avoid the confrontation. All weapons you get at certain story points or completing special side quests.\n\nThe gameplay combines the survival aspect with constant fights and the necessity to explore every piece of locations in order to find useful items. As a result, I Am Alive receives the features of a tactical action genre that expand the gaming experience you get.",

This story consists of trials and adventures of the members of this family. The story covers three generations, the action takes place not only in Daventry, but also in neighboring lands.\n\nThe interface of the game combines point-and-click with quick time events. There are also logical puzzles and action sequences. The development of the plot depends on the actions and words of the main character, the same episode can be started and completed in different ways. At the same time, in the end, the choice of the player only affects the actions of the secondary characters - they can either help the protagonist or not.",

    "description": "Papo & Yo is an adventure puzzle with a platforming focus. Indie studio Minority Media developed the game. After the development of Papo & Yo studio has concentrated on developing VR games. It is the only installment in the IP.\nThe plot revolves around the boy called Quico who is living in the Brazilian suburbs, and his father addicted to alcohol. As told by Vander Caballero — lead game designer, the game represents his experience with his alcoholic father. The ability to open tears to another dimension is like this a particular kind of representing escapism. \nThe game features platforming sections, and the ability to turn the real world into the magical one is introduced: tools brought out from the latter may aid the protagonist in their quest. The whole magical setting is very much like going into another dimension for the stuff needed. The Monster is also a crucial part of the gameplay — he helps Quico to hop around the gaps. The behemoth can also turn berserk: if he eats too many frogs, he starts crushing everything on its way. It can be calmed down with fruits.",

    "description": "In the sci-fi game Offworld Trading Company, the player can lead an interplanetary corporation in a futuristic trade war for control of Mars.\n\n###Gameplay\nThe game mixes resource mining and construction used in real-time strategies with a stronger economic element. The player has to choose a company he or she will control. The other three companies become the player's rivals. They seldom fight outright, and their rivalry is largely economic. However, they can secretly organize acts of sabotage against each other, eliminate resources with underground nukes and hire goons to attack or defend. The main goal of the game is to assume control over all four companies by purchasing their majority stakes and to create a monopoly. If a rival company obtains the majority in the player's corporation, he or she loses the game.\n\n###Resources\nThe game puts a strong emphasis on mining and trading resources. Each level starts with the player scanning the surface of Mars to find resources and build his or her headquarters next to them. Offworld Trading Company has thirteen types of resources. Most of the resources, such as iron, aluminum, and water, can be mined from the Martian soil. Some, like steel, food, and chemicals, are produced from other resources and require special buildings. Each resource has a value that can increase or decrease depending on the demand and supply.",

    "description": "The world ended 37 minutes ago\r\nIt is time to begin\r\nYaughton, Shropshire. 06:37am 6th June 1984.\r\nDeep within the Shropshire countryside, the village of Yaughton stands empty. Toys lie forgotten in the playground, the wind blows quarantine leaflets around the silent churchyard. Down on Appleton’s farm, crops rustle untended. The birds lie where they have fallen.\r\nStrange voices haunt the radio waves as uncollected washing hangs listlessly on the line. The televisions are tuned to vacant channels. Above it all, the telescopes of the Observatory point out at dead stars and endless darkness. And someone remains behind, to try and unravel the mystery.\r\nImmerse yourself in a rich, deep adventure from award-winning developer The Chinese Room and investigate the last days of Yaughton Valley. Uncover the traces of the vanished community; discover fragments of events and memories to piece together the mystery of the apocalypse.\r\nFeaturing a beautiful, detailed open-world and a haunting soundtrack, Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture is non-linear storytelling at its best.",

    "description": "Retro City Rampage is a 2D action-adventure game with heavy focus on the parody of pop-culture, retro video games, and open-world action-adventure genre. The story follows The Player, a criminal who works for a crime syndicate. One day he steals a time-traveling telephone booth that sends him several decades into the future. Shortly after his time-machine breaks and now with the help of Doc Choc, a time-traveler and Emmett Brown parody, he seeks for the parts to repair the booth.  \nThe gameplay can be described as if original GTA was ported onto the 16-bit console. It mostly has a top-down perspective with several 2D side-scrolling transitions. The game is set in the big open city which player can freely explore. The game has many story missions, side missions and challenges. Like in GTA games, violent actions made by the player can attract police that would try to neutralize him. The wide a range of weapons and tools can be acquired in shops, as rewards or from enemies.  \nThe DX version was initially released for Nintendo 3DS via eShop. This version rebalanced weapons, has several gameplay tweaks and features the “prototype” version of the game which was first made as NES ROM.",

But it does not go according to plan as Dayton gets killed. Alex is framed for his murder and sent to prison. Five years pass, an FBI agent proposes a deal to Alex. He will be let go if he helps expose a corrupt FBI Special Agent. Alex agrees and sets out to seek revenge.\n\nThe Crew features a vast open world that resembles the scaled down version of the modern United States. The map is divided into five regions each of which features different geography and weather. The game's missions can be played alone or in a player's crew. The game is online-only nonetheless. Apart from the usual races, players can participate in so-called skill challenges. After every mission, the player's score is saved and displayed to all his friends. Online matchmaking allows up to eight players to participate in one race.",

The player controls a small squad of soldiers who need to achieve the mission's goal - the destruction of all enemy forces.\n\nAll movement is planned in advance, one move is limited to 5 seconds. Before the final decision, you can simulate the results of your turn, but after pressing the button Prime, all actions are brought into effect and it is impossible to change the result. The calculations take into account the cover factor, reaction and aiming of each individual unit. A total of 5 kinds of units in the game, they differ in the speed of movement and weapons.\n\nThe game's events unfold in a gloomy cyberpunk future. The player commands rebels that are fighting against government troops. There is a cooperation mode for the campaign available with DLC bought and multiplayer, which is limited by 1vs1 duel-fights",

    "description": "The goal of the game is to pass level by level, finding an exit from each to the next. The difficulty, the challenge and at the same time the solution is that the levels are designed in the world of drawings by M. C. Escher. Top, bottom, right, left, floor, ceiling, stairs and walls are not in their usual places, not fixed and pass into each other quite differently than in the real world. However, the solution is sought precisely by turning over, rotating and other unusual, impossible actions with all this.\n\n48 puzzles await the hero throughout the game. Each puzzle has its own unique solution.\n\nAfter the hero passes the main story of the game, its alternative version will open. Alternative version includes alternative versions of half of the puzzles, 24 pieces. And, accordingly, 24 variants of the end of the game.\nDuring the game, you can step back and change the decision - so you can not be upset if an error has been committed.",

    "description": "The game is an improved version of the game Bionic Commando, previously released for the platform Nintendo.\n\nTwo states, the Federation and the Empire, compete with each other. One of the trump cards in this game is the project \"Albatross\", which at first is known only that this superweapon. The Federation suspects that the Empire is working on this project and will soon finish it. The Federation sends a national hero named Super Joe to disrupt the plan. But Super Joe fails the mission and becomes a prisoner. The detachment led by Nathan Spencer goes to help Joe. Nathan is more fortunate, he gradually learns about the project \"Albatross\" more and more - in the end it turns out that the goal of the project was the resurrection of Adolf Hitler. Moreover, the project is completed and Hitler has already come to life. Nathan will have to destroy Hitler again.\n\nThe gameplay consists of moving the hero through the levels and destroying the enemies. Nathan has a bionic hand - it adds novelty and variety to the game. Nathan with this hand can move through the levels to get to the bosses and transitions to the next level, and to gain access to bonuses. On the other hand, because the hand is very heavy, the hero can not jump. The theme of bionic devices is the basis of puzzles, which are also present in the game.",

    "description": "Not A Hero is an indie cover-based 2D shooter game developed by Roll7.\n\nA purple rabbit named BunnyLord uses time travel to become a mayor and save the world from the alien invasion. In order to prove to the people that he has to be elected, he hires freelance anti-heroes to get rid of the crime in the city.\n\nNot A Hero features a unique pixelated style. At the beginning of each level, the player chooses one out of nine characters. Each character has their own traits and a set of unique gameplay changes. The players have a primary weapon that they can upgrade either temporarily or until the level is completed. Special weapons are also available, such as automatic turrets or exploding cats.\n\nThere is no jumping in the game, yet the player can slide. Sliding can be used to get into cover against the in-game objects or tackle enemies which makes them easier to kill. The characters can withstand several hits and the health is restored pretty fast.\n\nThe game features different objectives for each level, but every one of them is issued by BunnyLord.",

    "description": "Quantum Conundrum is a first-person puzzle-solving game developed by Airtight Games. The director of the game, Kim Swift, was a lead designer of a game called Portal.\n\nYou play as a nephew of a brilliant scientist who is unexpectedly sent to stay with his uncle. The Professor is working on an experiment that goes not according to the plan. The scientist can't get out of a pocket dimension and the house you were staying in is now shattered across four dimensions with different properties. You have to get everything back together.\n\nThe player is able to run, jump and interact with several in-game objects. It is possible to die from hazardous liquids, bottomless pits, falling down from a great height or getting killed by lasers. The levels in the game are represented as the rooms of the house. The objective of each level is to find the exit door and get to it.\n\nThe players can manipulate the rooms traversing through the dimensions. Each dimension has its own physics. For example, in the Fluffy dimension, the objects are much lighter than normal. Players can access only one dimension at a time.",

    "description": "Virginia is a silent game that offers the player to become an FBI detective and solve a mystery. It was inspired by supernatural thrillers like Twin Peaks and X-Files.\n\n###Plot\nAs its name suggests, the game is set in Virginia, in a fictional country town called Kingdom. A small boy named Lucas Fairfax disappeared recently. The main protagonist, a young and inexperienced FBI agent Anne Tarver, has to uncover the mystery and find the child. Since she lacks the necessary experience, Tarver is accompanied by a higher ranking agent Maria Halperin. The two don't trust each other, but they have to overcome their differences and work together.\n\n###Gameplay\nVirginia's gameplay is similar to interactive movies and \"walking simulators.\" The player controls Anne and travels around the city, accompanied by Halperin, to find clues and learn more about what's going on in the city. The player has no actual control over the actions of the protagonist. Instead, he or she can only navigate Tarver over the city and then watch her act. The game is very short, and two hours is usually enough to complete it.\n\n###Style\nThe game is made in an intentionally low-poly visual style. There are no dialogues, neither in subtitles nor voice acting. The player can only understand the narrative through the facial expressions and body language of the characters, as well as the other clues.",

    "description": "Q.U.B.E: Director's Cut is a puzzle game developed by Toxic games. The Director's Cut adds new story elements to the game and new voice acted lines along with new levels and music. VR support was also added.\n\nThe players find themselves in a sterile environment aboard a mysterious space cube-like ship that is on a collision course with Earth. The player is contacted with by another astronaut that warns the player that they have to find a way to find a way off the ship which will cause it to self-destruct. You set out on your mission.\n\nUpon coming to, you find yourself in a suit and with a pair of gloves that manipulate the in-game objects. The environment around you is made out of blocks that can be moved in a specific way based on their colors. Some blocks are made to be extended or retracted, some are used as a trampoline, while others can rotate some parts of the walls upon interaction. \n\nAs the game progresses, the puzzles get harder and harder. In some cases, the players have to remember the setup of the blocks in the room as the only visible blocks in the room are the colored ones.",

    "description": "Zeno Clash II is a fantasy action game that combines multiple genres. Like its predecessor, Zeno Clash (2009), it uses the first-person view.\n\n###Plot\nThe setting of Zeno Clash II is a weird fantasy world called Zenozoik. The main protagonist of the original game, Ghat, makes a return. His companion Deadra, however, is replaced by Ghat's sister Rimat, who was one of his opponents in the previous game. The two siblings put their differences aside to team up against a new villain: a golem called Kax-Teh. Years ago, Ghat brought this creature with him to Zenozoik, and now the golem became too powerful for Ghat to tolerate.\n\n###Gameplay\nThe game features an unusual combination of role-playing, fighting and beat 'em up elements. The player controls Ghat, accompanied by AI-controlled Rimat, and leads him through a series of battles. The gameplay mostly consists of hand-to-hand fights, though the player can occasionally use weapons. Zeno Clash II has a unique combat system in which the amount of damage depends on which body part was hit. All battle movements cost stamina that has to be replenished. The RPG element allows the characters to improve their skills and abilities as they progress through the game. They can also find and equip new items. \n\n###Modes\nZeno Clash II introduced a new cooperative multiplayer mode, in which the second player assumes the role of Rimat. There are also the Arena modes, which allow the players to fight each other or a series of AI-controlled opponents.",

    "description": "Bionic Commando is the sixth installment in the series of this name. It is a science fiction game in which the protagonist can use his robotic arm for various purposes.\n\n###Plot\nThe game directly continues the plot of the original 1988 NES game. It is set in the near future, ten years after the first Bionic Commando. The protagonist of the previous part, Nathan \"R.A.D.\" Spencer, a \"bionic\" cyborg soldier, makes a return. He is voiced by Mike Patton, the vocalist of Faith No More.\n\nDespite his heroic deeds, Spencer was framed for crimes he was not guilty of and sentenced to be executed. The government releases the protagonist after a terrorist attack that destroys the whole Ascension City. Spencer has to clear his name and earn his freedom by finding and defeating the perpetrators of the attack, the BioReign organization.\n\n###Gameplay\nThe player controls Nathan from the third person view. Unlike the original Bionic Commando, the sequel is in 3D. The level design allows the player to fully explore all three dimensions as it includes skyscrapers the protagonist has to climb. \n\nThe most definitive part of the Bionic Commando gameplay is Spencer's retractable bionic arm. The limb increases his reach and strength, allowing the protagonist to swing across the gaps and canyons and throw heavy objects and enemies. The player can also use two types of guns: the Tungsten gun for weak rapid fire and the Prototype gun for powerful single shots.",

There is an open world which is permitted to discover at any time in contrary with, for instance, Most Wanted, where the environment was zoned, and the locations opened as the story progressed.\nThe car collisions system has become more realistic compared to the previous parts of the game, but damage remained cosmetic only with no impact on performance. However, the car may be destroyed in Highway Battle — one of the game mods. \nThe title features some RPG elements — wheelman points, which grants the player access to bonus levels and car parts. \nThe police in the game are traced by the bar at the top of the screen varying between Busted and Evade modes. The capturing of the player results in the checkpoint restart.\n\n###Plot \nThe game's title suggests the protagonist role in the story — he is an undercover police agent given a task to infiltrate the group of street-racers to expose them to arrest. The background behind the races is taking down the criminal gangs and cliques. During the narrative player is faced with some dilemmas demanding a hard choice of him on which side to take.",

    "description": "The Elder Scrolls: Legends is a card-based game set in The Elder Scrolls universe developed by Dire Wolf Digital.\r\n\r\n###Story\r\nThe game's story serves as a tutorial for the player. The game takes place during the Great War between the Mid Empire and the Third Aldmer Dominion. The main antagonist of the game is one of the admirals of the Dominion - an altmer named Naarifin who is a Daedric cult adept. He invades the Empire trying to open the gates of Oblivion. The player has to prevent such an event from happening and make difficult choices as these decisions affect the cards the player gets upon completing the story mode.\r\n\r\n###Gameplay\r\nThe game centers around turn-based card matches between two opponents. Several game modes are available: Duel and Arena. In Duel, the players start with their own hand of cards, while in Arena each player picks the hand out of a limited number of cards.\r\n\r\nThe cards are divided into four categories: Creatures, Supports, Actions, and Items. The players decide which Tamriel race they want to play as. This choice affects the additional cards that will be dropped as a reward after leveling up.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the match, each player starts out with one magic point and three cards. On each turn, one magic point is granted to the players. The first player to get his enemies health to less than 1 wins.",

    "description": "2064: Read Only Memories is a retro game set in a cyberpunk world. \n\n###Setting\nThe game takes place in the near future of 2046. At this point, the technological advancements allowed people to augment their bodies and enter virtual reality. Most importantly, the robotic assistants called ROMs became increasingly popular and largely replaced the regular phones. The main producer of the robots is a corporation called Parallax, and it plans to create a new kind of fully independent AI. There's a rebel party called Human Revolution that aims to stop the progress of the AI.\n\n###Plot\nThe main engineer of Parallax, Hayden Webber, recently was abducted. The main protagonist is a journalist who researches the Webber's disappearance. He or she is accompanied by Turing, a highly advanced robotic assistant. They go on a search in the fictional city of Neo-San Francisco on the eve of Christmas.\n\n###Gameplay\n2064: Read Only Memories works as a point-and-click adventure game with a static first-person view. The environment and characters are presented to the player as slightly animated images. He or she can interact with them by clicking and choosing options, such as to look at, to take, or to speak to. \n\n###Style\nThe game is made in the vein of the 1980s and 1990s graphic adventure games. It uses pixel art visual style with minimal animation and neon-lighted environments, accompanied by a synthwave music score.",

    "description": "This is a top-down shooter with stick controls and hand-to-hand combat. The player has jet-pack for additional maneuverability. The plot of the game tells about three actors and the film of the same name. The story told in the visual style inspired by 50s American science fiction.\r\n\r\nSpace Explorer Dick Starspeed was wrecked on a mysterious planet. To find parts for a broken ship and his faithful assistant Robot, Dick goes on a dangerous journey across an unknown planet. The game presents a very diverse set of weapons: ray guns, crystal swords, and laser whips. All devices in the game can be improved with the help of spare parts found on the levels.\r\n\r\nThe game focuses on the movie style: in the settings, you can turn on the comments of the alleged director of the film. They are the link between the setting, the characters and the events that take place on the set. In addition to the story campaign, the game has a Survival mode, which is entirely independent. The player receives some gold and weapons and is surrounded by enemies in the arena. A full-fledged multiplayer is not here, but the game still can be played on one device in a cooperative mode.",

He soon realizes that these - along with the clinically pre-occupied townspeople, secret societies, and peculiar sounds from the forest - are intimately connected to the core mystery. And what's with the gnomes?\nCreated with indie comic artist Graham Annable's unique narrative and visual sensibilities, delivered with the distinctive Telltale storytelling style, Puzzle Agent is sure to challenge, thrill and engage in more ways than you can shake a cryptogram at!\nPlentiful puzzles to challenge your neurons. See if you can find every puzzle to solve the mystery of Scoggins -- mazes, logic, riddles, brainteasers and more.\nInvestigate the strange, peculiar and mind-boggling to crack the case! Your discoveries provide clues to the larger mystery crippling the town, or uncover puzzles that must be solved to reveal answers ... or even more questions.\nHunting for Hints: Chewing gum helps Agent Tethers think and solve.

    "description": "The game belongs to the genre of Arkanoid. It has all the classic features of games of this genre and several significant innovations and differences. The platform in this game has the ability to attract or repel all objects that are \"in the air\". This property is controlled by the player. In addition to the platform, other objects have similar properties, but they can not be controlled by the player.\n\nAfter several levels, the platform changes its horizontal position to a vertical one - and there are many similar changes in the game, it constantly surprises the player.\n\nBosses, which the player meets at the end of each level, are carefully and ingeniously designed. They are able to successfully resist the player armed with the above ability to influence the \"magnetic field\" of the platform. To defeat each of them, the player will have to find some special tactics for each boss.",

Enter your clan into the league and fight together to make your mark on the leaderboards. Nobody wants an empty trophy cabinet!\nSlick Single Player Gameplay Too\nStory Mode’ adds a ton of variety by introducing physics based contraptions for the first time ever. A plethora of interesting machinery spices up the gameplay, and makes solo Worms™ much more fun! The single‐player game isn’t only about dealing death and destruction, it’s also about negotiating tricky swinging rope bridges and rescuing friendlies from death defying traps! The player spends much more time playing, and much less time waiting for their A.I. opponent to take a shot.\nAdditional hardware required for Remote Play.\nUse of PSN and SEN account are subject to the Terms of Service and User Agreement and applicable privacy policy (see terms at sonyentertainmentnetwork.com/terms-of-service & sonyentertainmentnetwork.com/privacy-policy). *Online multiplayer also requires a PlayStation®Plus subscription.\n1-4 players\nNetwork Players 2-4\nDUALSHOCK®4\nRemote Play\n1080p HD Video Output\nOnline Play (Optional)\nSoftware subject to license (us.playstation.com/softwarelicense).

    "description": "We Happy Few is the tale of a plucky bunch of moderately terrible people trying to escape from a lifetime of cheerful denial in the city of Wellington Wells. In this alternative 1960s England, conformity is key. You’ll have to fight or blend in with the drug-addled inhabitants, most of whom don’t take kindly to people who won’t abide by their not-so-normal rules.\nDiscover the retrofuturistic city’s dark history as you play through the intertwined narratives of three quietly rebellious citizens of Wellington Wells, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, as they face their pasts, prepare for the future, and engage in activities that aren’t exactly status quo in the artificially enthused society.\nSave 15% when you pre-purchase We Happy Few, and get instant access to the game's alpha. This allows you to experience the introduction to Arthur's narrative, explore a portion of the procedurally generated world, collect and craft items, and choose how you’ll interact with members of the Joy-obsessed society through stealth, combat, or conformity across a handful of the game’s unique events.\nPlus, get the exclusive in-game Jolly Brolly weapon at launch. There’s a definite chance of pain when using this weaponized umbrella, complete with advanced blocking capabilities and trippy psychedelic interior.\nRetrofuturistic 1960s England\nSet in retrofuturistic 1960s England, you will find a city ravaged by war and rebuilt by delusionally happy people. Everything appears joyful in Wellington Wells, including its roads, its people, and its omnipresent television personality: Uncle Jack! But, it’s actually a world on the brink of collapse. Come unveil its dark history, and discover how and why its residents came to be so beguilingly happy.\nThree Interwoven Narratives\nPlay as three flawed characters who explore their own connections to the events surrounding the rebuilding of Wellington Wells. They each have a unique storyline in which they interpret and react to the events around them in different ways. As you hide, conform, or fight back as each of them, you will encounter dark humour, a spot of hope, and even some redemption along the way.\nA Dystopia of Your Very Own\nIn We Happy Few, no two playthroughs are alike. While the citizens of Wellington Wells will always want to ensure that you’ve taken your Joy, the procedurally generated world will ensure that your experience with We Happy Few is different and unique.  Wellington Wells is never quite like you remember it.\nTake Your Joy…or Don’t. The Choice is Yours\nCustomize your We Happy Few experience:\n•\tChoose from a range of difficulties for new and experienced players alike,\n•\tPlay through the story, or make your own story by customizing the sandbox,\n•\tMasochistic? Try permadeath!,\n•\tCollect recipes, scavenge items, and craft dozens of weapons, tools, and devices,\n•\tCreep, crush, or conform your way through puzzles and encounters, and\n•\tFight with the crazy weapons you can craft, or fight with your bare hands and don’t kill anyone!",

    "description": "Lone Survivor: The Director's Cut is a version of the game Lone Survivor, released as an addition to the game Lone Survivor.\n\nThe hero is a person who turned out to be isolated from other people and therefore did not become infected with a virus that turned the remaining people into aggressive mutants.\nThe hero leaves his apartment to explore neighboring apartments in search of food and other survivors. The hope to find other survivors is fueled by the messages found by the hero, which say that somewhere these survivors still exist.\n\nMirrors serve as portals for getting into the apartment of the survivor and back. This apartment is a place where you can stay safe and sleep - it will allow the hero to keep mental health, otherwise he runs the risk of going insane.\nDuring sleep, the hero comes to dreams, and sometimes hallucinations. Their content depends on the type of sleeping pills that the hero takes. Hallucinations can visit the hero regardless of sleep and cheerfulness. Because of this, the same rooms can look quite differently during visits at different times. The hero (and the player), in general, quickly realize that with the adequacy of the perception of the hero something is very wrong.\nA flashlight helps to move forward, and mutants make it difficult to advance. They can be killed, but you can pass unnoticed by them. To kill mutants, the hero uses weapons.\n\nSometimes progress is impossible without a special things that must be found.\nDepending on the choices and actions of the player, you can end the game with five different endings.",

Each and every gameplay session will give you an entirely new chance to prove if you have what it takes not only to survive, but to best the most prolific killer in cinema history, a slasher with more kills than any of his rivals!\nMeanwhile, Jason will be given an array of abilities to track, hunt and kill his prey. Stalk from the shadows, scare your targets and kill them when the time is right in as brutal a fashion as you can imagine.

Playing as a counselor is all about risk and reward, giving players multiple means of triumph over Jason! Want to hide in the woods as you wait for the police? Perhaps you want to band together and try to take on Jason as a group? Maybe you and a friend decide to fix the boat on the lake and escape while leaving everyone else to their fate? There are endless opportunities to survive the night, but every choice has a consequence.\nFriday the 13th: The Game will continually set the pace of change, giving you unfamiliar surroundings while Jason Voorhees looks for his latest victim.

    "description": "Knack is a beat 'em up platformer released by SCE Japan. It is the first title in the series, followed by Knack II, released 4 years afterward. The game was fancied to be a new generation Crash Bandicoot, it released simultaneously with the PS4 console and was provided bundled in some regions. \nGameplay centers around its self-titled protagonist whose primary ability is to disintegrate into little pieces called Relics and absorb various materials to be its parts. Thus Knack may turn into ice- iron- and crystal Knack getting bigger and smaller depending on the number of respectable materials within him. Other than that Knack is a usual beat them up: the player will be dodging, jumping, punching and kicking enemies in various fashions. \nThe game tells a story of a high-end world populated with advanced humans who have discovered the powers of Relics to compose Knack-like creatures and goblins who are presented as a lower race continually trying to start a war or rob humans.",

    "description": "Halo is a franchise of first-person shooters that is set in the far future, on the frontiers of colonized planets, in a war with the Covenant. But Halo: Spartan Assault takes the formula and changes one element of the setting. Now players are experiencing the series through an isometric top-down twin-stick shooter. The game story takes place between Halo 3 and Halo 4, where humans and Covenant signed a ceasefire to stop the war. Through the treacherous attack that some rogue Covenant group carried out, the leadership of the aliens learns that one of the moons surrounding Draetheus V is an ancient planetary weapon. And it’s up to Spartans Sarah Palmer and Davis to stop the destruction and fight back.\r\nThe game allows players to participate in weekly challenges on top of story campaign consisting of 30 levels. All Halo weapons and transports up to the release date were added, players access armor abilities and even customize their Spartan.",

    "description": "The game is set in the cartoonish universe of birds that was first introduced in Rocketbirds: Revolution. The city of Albatropolis was subdued by a ruthless army of penguins led by dictator Putzki. You assume the role of Hardboiled Chicken, a rebel commando rooster who is tasked with killing the tyrant. He will, however, eventually discover there’s much more behind the penguins’ plot. \nThe game is divided into “chapters” which are split into very small levels, usually the size of one screen each. There are also several air levels in which Hardboiled Chicken flies on his jetpack. Most of the time, though, he walks through penguin military bases, climbing, hiding, solving puzzles, and shooting the guards on his way with various firearms. This is where the game’s “childish” visual style and tongue-in-cheek humor contrast its bloody action. There’s a co-op mode for two players that mostly uses the same maps but is based on a different plot about a kidnapped general's daughter.  \nRocketbirds: Hardboiled Chicken is most famous for music. Many intros, animated cutscenes and even some of the levels are set to synth rock music by the Austrian band New World Revolution.",

    "description": "Overgrowth is an indie action game developed by Wolfire Games. It serves as a sequel to Lugaru, another title by the company.\n\n###Plot\nOn a fictional island of Lugaru, after many years after the extinction of humanity, the world is run by humanoid wolves, rabbits, rats, cats, and dogs.\n\nMost of Overgrowth's plot is not revealed yet, as the game is still in early access stage of production. The main character was carried over from the previous game. A rabbit named Turner that avenged his family by killing the Alpha wolf and a corrupt king. Turner refused to become the next king and left to explore the island.\n\n###Gameplay\nSimilar to the previous game, Overgrowth puts a strong emphasis on hand-to-hand combat. Attacks and counter-attacks are based on timing and contextual actions rather than the usual combos. \n\nThe game features an advanced physics-based animation system which allows for seamless transitions between animations. Every animation will be different based on the environment, the character's mood and even individual traits. \n\nLevels in Overgrowth introduce the players to their environment, tasks, and means of completing such tasks. Despite that, the players are free to explore the level as they see fit. This allows the players to find their own path to level completion. \n\nThe game features a sophisticated AI. The enemy characters can attack from the back or get together for an ambush. If the AI decides that it has no chance of winning, the enemies fall back.",

    "description": "Velocity 2X is a 2D sci-fi shoot'em up developed by FutureLab. It is the third game in the series, preceded by Velocity Ultra and Velocity. The primary focus of all three games is competing with the other players, teleporting and fighting numerous enemies — the game features some characteristics of bullet hell genre.\nThe story centers around Apex Predator — the protagonist of the game. While being set in a sci-fi setting the game tells a story of her modified body, which allows her and her ship to travel at supersonic speeds and uncover the mysteries of a world she ended up blending in.\nThe gameplay utilizes typical characteristics for the genre: much shooting, teleporting and reaching the higher overall score over the levels. The title also features dual-format: not only it allows to mirror the screen and make the levels more challenging but also it creates a room for bosses to be more robust.",

    "description": "Mankind has learned to travel in time and uses this knowledge to improve its present. Namely, in every possible way corrects the past in order to be in a better present.\nOf course, fixing the past is not an easy task. This is the responsibility of the military organization - the Super Time Force. Brave Commander Repeatski boldly sends time-traveling fighters to various points in time, including prehistoric times and the Middle Ages. Sometimes to improve the present he has to send fighters to the future - and Commander Repeatski does not stop before that.\nThe matter is not limited to transferring fighters back and forth in time. Manipulate the time can not only Commander Repeatski, but also ordinary soldiers - they, too, can \"rewind\" the time forward or backward - for example, during the fight, \"cancel\" the wrong decision, be five minutes earlier and do everything as needed.\nAnd one more useful thing is the slow motion mode, if at normal speed it is difficult to pass.\nThe player has 30 lives. Levels are sufficiently filled with well-armed opponents, and so many lives - it's not so much. The characters you can play the game are sixteen. Everyone has his own weapon. And everyone can achieve six levels of skill.",

    "description": "Assassin’s Creed Freedom Cry is a standalone expansion for Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag and set 12 years after its events. The game introduces a brand new character - a pirate called Adéwalé who joins the Order of Assassins in order to stop slavery in Haiti. He confronts the local government and starts to sabotage their actions.\n\nFreedom Cry, like the original game, is a pirate-themed title with an accent on sea battles. The story is split into nine missions. You can explore an open-world sea map and attack ships to set slaves free. The ship development system and the amount of weaponry are reduced compared to Black Flag. The game also features land missions and side quests that allow you to upgrade your character and get additional bonuses. You even can recruit unchained slaves to your crew so they will help you in battles.\n\nFreedom Cry follows the traditions of the series and combines stealth elements, used mostly during city missions with open combat. You have several weapon types including swords, guns and throwing knives to distract enemies.",

    "description": "Zombie Driver HD is a single-player action game, combining elements of shooter and racing. The events set in a zombie apocalypse environment. \n\n###Modes \nThere are three game modes. The first one is a classical story mode.\nYou play as a taxi driver, who is doing his work when the virus appears. You need to get to the military checkpoint, where you have to complete different missions: picking up survivors around the city, transporting something or even killing. You have to fight with the bosses – substantial mutated zombies. In the second mode, Blood Race, the player enters the brutal race. You can chase the cars and take them down. There are three distinct game types: classic race; eliminator, where the player needs to take down cars as many as he can; the endurance, in which you need to race with a ticking bomb in your vehicle. The last one is Slaughter. You try to survive on different arenas as long as you can. \n\n###Gameplay \nAs for the vehicles, there are 13 types of driving. It includes a fire truck, bulldozer, and tank.\nEvery vehicle feels different, so you can taste it and choose the most convenient one. Upgrading the vehicle on the fly is possible. The game offers the variety of weapons. You can burn zombies with flamethrowers or attack with the launcher. You fight with crowds of zombies at a time, especially in the Slaughter mode. The types of enemies can be unusual: there are zombies dogs, for instance. Medical drops, scattered around the city, can help to manage your health.",

    "description": "I am Bread is an adventure game developed by Bossa Studios. The game is set in the same universe as Surgeon Simulator 2013 and serves as a prequel to it.\n\n###Plot\nA paranoid therapy patient starts noticing slices of bread or toast moving in his house. He takes it as a warning from an unknown party or as a taunt. The patient later finds out that the only reason behind the slices of bread being moved around is that the bread became sentient. A chain of incidents with the involvement of the bread leads to the Patient, mister Murton, having a heart attack and crashing his car. After the crash, he is taken to a hospital by the Surgeon that is the main character of Surgeon Simulation 2013.\n\n###Gameplay\nThe players control a slice of bread with the objective of making toast. It is essential to keep an eye out on the edibility meter, as the players can encounter environmental hazards, such as fluids, before turning into a toast. Each level of the game represents a different day of the week.\n\nThe game was thoroughly supported with multiple expansion packs. Several new types of bread were added, such as a baguette, a bagel, or a cracker. The type of bread chosen changes the objective the players have to complete. For example, while playing as a baguette, the players have to destroy all the fragile objects they find in the room.\n\nNew levels were also added to the game. One of which is a crossover with Team Fortress 2 and its sandwich item.",

    "description": "God game genre is long forgotten. Only a few remember old and classic games such as Black & White series. Reus managed to revive this genre. In this game the player can control giants who have the ability to terraform and can provide certain resources like animals, plants and minerals which are more than 100 in the game, which lets them to create life and alter genes as well as to modify the nature of the planet which is two-dimensional. The player also has an option to experiment with various terrain types. But most importantly, giants have to provide support to humans on the planet. Although, the player cannot control humans yet player’s actions can change human’s behavior. The player has the option to let giants either praise or punish humans on the planet and the player can help humans to achieve various developments. There is a complex system of upgrades in the game. Reus has a unique art style and interesting soundtrack. This is a gem for everyone who feel nostalgia for god game genre.",

    "description": "Giana Sisters: Twisted Dreams is the third game in the series that was started by Giana Sisters, a 1987 platformer. The original game was a Super Mario rip-off, but, though the new game retained many of the old mechanics (such as defeating enemies by jumping on them), there are also novel gameplay ideas.\nYou play as Giana, a girl who tries to rescue her sister Maria from the hands of an evil dragon Gurglewocky. Giana herself has two different personalities, a \"Cutie\" and a \"Punk\", that can be switched during the game. This change also dramatically alters the environment, allowing the player to shift between two dream worlds: one is a brightly colored garden, while other is a dark, nightmarish forest of giant mushrooms. In both worlds, the levels are nearly identical, despite the aesthetic change. But sometimes the game may demand you to switch to another world to move forward or to obtain a powerup that only exists in one of the worlds.\nA definitive feature of Giana Sisters: Twisted Dreams is its music. The score was composed by Chris Hulsbeck, who worked with the original Giana Sisters, and metal band Machinae Supremacy. The soundtrack shifts between “traditional” and \"heavy\" versions of the same compositions to highlight the game's dual nature.",

    "description": "Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War III is a real-time strategy game developed by Relic Entertainment. This is the third part of the Dawn of War series. \n\n###Plot \nThe game is set in a dystopian vision of the future. In the universe, humanity developed a galaxy empire called The Imperium of Man.\nThe characters include human beings and monsters, such as the Eldar and the Ork races. The story starts at a lost planet called Acheron, where characters discover a deadly weapon called the Spear of Khaine. The Space Marines assemble at Acheron to find the deadly weapon. The main characters come from the main fractions, the Space Marines, the Eldar, and the Orks. The plot revolves around their interactions. \n\n###Gameplay \nThe gameplay is set from the third point of view; the player can shift the screen to see the whole stage. He is also able to choose for whose side to perform: the Space Marines, the Eldar or the Orks. In the multiplayer mode, it is possible to use various skins for each fraction. \n\n###Reception \nAfter the previous game, Dawn of War II, the developers used innovative graphics details, graphics, and new items.

    "description": "Steam Big Picture Mode\nAbout the GameProteus is a game about exploration and immersion in a dream-like island world where the soundtrack to your play is created by your surroundings. Played in first-person, the primary means of interaction is simply your presence in the world and how you observe it.  The procedurally generated islands are home to creatures natural and imagined, tranquil valleys and ruins with magical properties.Key Features: Meditative play: the responsive world and lack of any text or hints distils an essence of curious, investigative play, and rewards patience and immersion.\nDynamic soundtrack composed by award-winning musician David Kanaga follows the mood of the world and will appeal to fans of Boards of Canada, Brian Eno.\nA distinctive 2D-but-3D graphical style with wild shifting palettes that sits somewhere between 8-bit videogames and early 20th century modernist painting.\nIslands are uniquely generated every time, and although it's theoretically possible to see everything in one playthrough, no-one ever does.\nBuilt-in \"postcard\" function encodes world data into each screenshot, allowing islands and discoveries to be saved and shared.",

    "description": "Homefront: The Revolution is an open-world FPS developed by Dambuster Studios. It is the second game in the series.\r\n\r\n###Plot\r\nIn 1972, a technological marvel emerged in North Korea. The APEX corporation was found. Sometime later, the North Korean technologies become more widespread than the US. In 2004 the United States began to buy its weaponry from Korea. By 2016 the United States economy is at an all-time low, the US invade the Middle East. In 2025, the US debt to North Korea grows too immense to be paid out, and the economy crumbles. While being helpful at first, North Korea's military set foot on the American soil. You become a part of the resistance based in Philadelphia in 2029 trying to set the city free from Korean People's Army.\r\n\r\n###Gameplay\r\nThe players have to use the insurgency strategies in order to free the city of Philadelphia from the KPA. A wide set of explosives, jammers, and traps is available to the player. It is possible to modify the weapons the player has on the go. Attach suppressors, scopes or convert your weapon entirely as you see fit. \r\n\r\nPhiladelphia is split into three zones: the Green Zone where the KPA and their collaborators live in comfort with stable electricity supply and clean drinking water; the Yellow Zone which serves as a ghetto for most of the Philadelphia residents; the Red Zone which mostly consists of bombed-out suburbs of Philly. \r\n\r\nA four-player co-op mode is present in the game and is separated from the main campaign.",

The objective is referred to in the game as \"save the day\".  The Protagonist defuses the bombs in ridiculous and absurd ways. For example, by kicking it. The players guide the main character, McPixel himself, by pointing and clicking at the screen. The game consists of four parts, which include three levels. It is possible to unlock a secret fourth level. Each level is composed of six sequences. There are multiple secrets and easter eggs hidden Throughout the levels. The game features several pixel filters, music that was typical for 8-bit games, and free downloadable content.\n\nA level editor is also provided by the developer.",

    "description": "###Crazy action\r\nDecember 3, 2016, on PS4, a single-user exclusive games called LET IT DIE was released. It was developed by the Japanese developer Grasshopper Manufacture. The release of the game on the PC is scheduled for the end of 2018. In short, what is waiting the player can be called a crazy incendiary hack and slash with the third person perspective, where the endless action and anime style graphics converged. Some aspects of the game are very reminiscent of Dark Souls.\r\n\r\n###The story\r\nThe story revolves around the corpse, which was suddenly revived. And yes - this is our main character if you can say so. Or the heroine - it depends on who you choose at the start screen. Anyway, if you die, you can just buy yourself a new shell and go on. There are a lot of locations to explore in the game. It depends on the player - exactly how to proceed - constantly using new bodies or to save money and after death to resurrect your favorite body. Note that it is very easy to die in this game. As for the goal - the player has to climb the tower, where at the very top lies the key to saving the whole world. There are more than forty floors in this tower. But this is only part of the story.\r\n\r\n###Change of plans\r\nInitially, the game supposed to be called Lily Bergamo, but at the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2014 conference, the name was changed to LET IT DIE. The development lasted no less than three and a half years. Also, the release date was unknown at some point, but developers managed to deliver. It came out on the model of Free to play, which attracted attention and received a lot of people who wanted to play.",

    "description": "Ziggurat is an indie first-person adventure dungeon crawling game developed by Milkstone Studios.\n\n###Gameplay\nThe game was heavily inspired by Heretic and Hexen, which are considered classic first-person shooters. You play as a sorcerer who seeks fame. He enters a mysterious labyrinth and faces all the dangers of an ancient dungeon. \n\nThe game revolves around fast-paced and action-packed first-person shooting classical mechanics. Several roguelike elements were also added into the mix which resulted in a completely different addition to the genre. The levels are procedurally generated so that every playthrough will be different. Leveling up and improving your skills is a must in order to survive countless enemy encounters. \n\nA perk system is also present in the game. Most of the perks featured in the game are designed for the players to create their own play style. The choice between the perks was purposely made simple. For example, the players have to choose between increased movement speed at the expanse of lower health or mana regeneration. \n\nThere is no inventory present in the game as it was streamlined in order to increase the gameplay speed. Instead of that, all the players have to manage is the comparison of several items, weapon selection, and the amount of mana and health.",

    "description": "The most reasonable rule of trade: if the goods are from far away – they should cost more. If you apply it to the space trade between the galaxies, you will get Rebel Galaxy, a space trading and combat simulation, created by a small studio of two people. Western style is complemented by licensed blues and country rock music tracks. \nThe universe is randomly generated, and players are taking control of the spacecraft, that can and will be replaced if needed. The game offers numerous activities for players, depending on what they are compelled to do. Salvage what’s left of the spaceship after the battle, mine the asteroids for resources, explore galactic anomalies or befriend aliens and trade with them. Not interested in trade and exploration? Any player can take on bounty hunting contracts or battling pirates. Combat in the Rebel Galaxy uses shooting gallery mechanics: the player and capital ships are restricted by two-dimensional movement, all non-player gunships are capable of maneuvering on X, Y and Z axis. And all that in addition to the story missions.",

    "description": "DC Universe Online is an MMO game set in the world of Batman and Superman. The game offers the player to become a completely new superhero or a supervillain.\n\n###Backstory\nThe game's opening cinematic tells how the greatest heroes and villains of the DC Universe annihilated each other in a future war. This left the Earth defenseless before the space conqueror Brainiac. The only survivor of this war, Lex Luthor, claims he came back to the present to prevent this catastrophe. He created nano-robots that grant superhuman powers and released them on Earth to create new metahumans. As a result, thousands of people develop extraordinary abilities and become superheroes or supervillains. One of this people is the player's character.\n\n###Character creation\nBefore entering the game, the player has to create his or her original, fully customizable DC character. The player can define the character's gender, looks, personality, powers, and other attributes, or to use pre-loaded templates. You also have to choose your side and decide if you're a hero or a villain. \n\n###Gameplay\nThe newly created character enters the DC Universe and immediately has to fight for his or her freedom as part of a tutorial mission. The player shares the world with thousands of other metahumans as well as AI-controlled famous heroes and villains from the DC Comics canon. All of them are involved in constant battles between good and bad. To become a member of Justice League or Secret Society of Super Villains, the character has to gain experience, complete quests and master his or her powers.",

    "description": "The game is played with cards on a special field. The goal of the game is to \"kill\" the opponent, laying out cards on the field. The game lets you compete with other players or AI. \n\nThe game takes place on an empty hexagonal field, two corners of which are occupied by avatars (against each other), and the other four corners are wells of Faeria (mana). Each player starts the game with thirty cards.\n\nAt the beginning of the turn, the player draws a card from their cards and receives three points of Faeria (mana). If by the player manages to take a well of mana, the player receives one mana point additionally for each well. The game also uses the Power Wheel, different cards have different potentials and affect the game in many ways. Laying out cards on the field also matters - laying out cards is regulated by the rules and gives as a result combinations of different strength and quality. Playing cards spends mana reserves, each card requires a certain amount of mana in reserve to play. And the enemy is harmed through a decrease in the health - the cards affect this figure. Victories give in-game currency to the player, which they can pay for new cards with and make the stock of cards unique.",

    "description": "Alien Breed: Impact is a part of the revival of an old game series, influenced profoundly by the Alien movies. After the last game of the series was published in 1996, reimagining the established format as a first-person shooter, the game was brought back to its roots, returning not only with the improved graphics, engine, and design but with the classic top-down shoot ‘em up genre. Theodore J. Conrad is a space engineer that has to restore the engines after the collision with a mysterious empty ship.\nAlien Breed: Impact is an updated version of Alien Breed: Evolution that adds not only new designs for the enemy aliens but an entirely new upgrade shop. It has two full story campaigns for both single player and multiplayer. In the multiplayer cooperative campaign, two players are taking the roles of two other survivors, Thadeus and Eddie, that are trying to find Conrad and assist him on his mission.",

    "description": "Cthulhu Saves The World is a parody RPG where you take on the role of Cthulhu, the lord of darkness who is meant to destroy the world. His powers were blocked by a magician, and now he needs to become a true hero to restore them and fulfill his mission. Inspired by Howard P. Lovecraft’s novels, the game turns the classic plot into a humorous story with multiple cultural references.\n\nThe game looks like a top-down old-school RPG with permanent fourth-wall breaking and numerous quests you can complete. Visually it uses pixel-art and pseudo-3D elements. During the game you meet different characters that join your party. Each of them has different attack types you can upgrade. These attacks are also unique; so, Cthulhu has the ability to make enemies insane.\n\nThe gameplay is focused on exploration, turn-based random fights and boss battles. There are nine dungeons you need to sweep, full of multiple monsters. You can unblock more game modes progressing through the game.",

    "description": "This game is both a puzzle and a platformer. The plot and the gameplay are based on the game with light.\nThe player plays like a little man, who is in almost total darkness. A spot of light snatches from the darkness a small part, in which the little man can move. The space for movement is limited by a spot of light, but sometimes outside of this spot or on the border of light and darkness it is possible to move quite freely - for example, even to pass through walls or fall through floors / ceilings. Sometimes it is not enough to be in a spot of light or in darkness for movement. The path is sometimes blocked by various obstacles, or this path simply needs to be found, it is necessary to understand how and where you can move - the goal of the game is to find the final exit.\n\nAmong the puzzles are the search for various keys and ways to apply these keys, finding and moving light sources and other things. The game assumes that sooner or later the player will master the relationship with the light and will be able to use this understanding to achieve the ultimate goal.",

    "description": "Vessel is a game about an engineer who operates machines in a heavily industrialized steampunk world. The player assumes the role of Arkwright, a genius scientist who invented a new type of automaton called Fluro. The Fluros are amorphous creatures that can be made of any type of liquid and perform tasks for people. One day, the Fluros mutated and went out of control, ruining most of the world’s machines. Arkwright has to find the cause of the malfunction and restore control over the Fluros. \nThe gameplay consists of solving physics-based puzzles and manipulating the ridiculously complex machinery in a 2.5D environment. Arkwright jumps the platforms and pushes buttons to activate machines in a certain way. He can also use devices called Seeds to create new Fluros out of the liquids found on the levels, including lava. The Fluros, in turn, can be manipulated to perform helpful actions, such as to pull switches that are inaccessible for Arkwright. The liquid is the central element of the game, and a special graphics engine was made to animate it. The music by the famous DJ Jon Hopkins works as a hint for the player, becoming more complex when he or she does the right actions.",

    "description": "Previously known as Rift: Planes of Telara and just as Heroes of Telara, it's free-to-play MMORPG in a fantasy setting.\n\nIn the world of the game - Telara - there is a conflict between two factions: the Guardians and the Defiant. The first worship the higher gods of Telara, among the representatives there are high elves, dwarves and the race of Northerner Mathosians.\n\nThe Defiant, on the contrary, does not adhere to any religion because of historical and cultural reasons or because of personal choice. They put more emphasis on technology and science. Among the representatives of this faction, one can find a race of highly advanced humans from the south called Eth, dark elves and a symbiosis between humans and Air-spirits called Bahmi.\n\nThe world of the game is divided into regions by the elements that are controlled by dragons-deities, personifying one of the basic elements: Air, Fire, Water, Earth, Life, and Death. In addition to the division into races, players can choose from five classes: Warrior, Cleric, Rogue, Mage or Primalis. The main emphasis in the game is made on the team raids, participation in PvP and PvE events.",

    "description": "Anomaly 2 is a sequel to Anomaly: Warzone Earth and the third part in the Anomaly mobile game series. Anomaly series inverted the classic tower defense genre to create an innovative \"tower offense\" type of strategy.\n\n###Plot\nThe game is set in the post-apocalyptic near future, sometime after the alien invasion of Earth that was described in Anomaly: Warzone Earth. By 2034, our planet is devastated and mostly covered with ice. The last remnants of humanity are trying to defeat the invading alien machines, who stay besieged in their highly fortified bases.\n\n###Gameplay\nLike its predecessors, Anomaly 2 puts the player in control of a convoy of armored vehicles. The goal of each mission is to fight your way through the enemy territory that is protected with defense towers and units. The game has no construction options or resource mining, but there are repair zones on each level. They allow the player to upgrade, purchase, or sell his or her units right in the middle of a mission. Anomaly 2 introduces a new gameplay option: morphing. All vehicles have more than one shape and can morph into different units with unique abilities.\n\n###Multiplayer\nAnomaly 2 is the first game in the series to introduce multiplayer. This mode allows playing as either humans or alien machines. Humans gameplay is the same as in single mode. Playing for the alien side, however, completely changes the game and turns it into the tower defense where the player's goal is to withstand the siege.",

Unlike the predecessors, Magic Duels has a story mode that focuses on five original Planeswalkers. In general, the game features over 1300 earnable cards.\n\nThe gameplay repeats the one from the card game but is simplified. You participate in duels either with real players or AI opponents. Each player has a deck of cards consisting of lands and spells. To cast spells you need mana that lands produce. The duel stops when one player’s life is over. In the story mode you need to hold matches against an AI opponent using decks of five Planeswalkers.\n\nBesides the story, there are several single-player missions and online duels. For example, you can test your strategy during the Two-headed Giant mode when four players split into teams competing with each other.",

    "description": "The game takes place in London after the zombie apocalypse. London, according to the creators of the game, was chosen as a setting, because it combines new and old styles of architecture with a rich history. In addition to the architectural heritage, London gave the game a start to the plot, a real historical personality - John Dee, who in the game is called the author of the Black Prophecy, which is associated with the invasion of zombies.\nThe game has a place not only for battles for the immediate survival, but also for performing tasks to find the vaccine against infection - the player has to look for different places, people and information. The game encourages exploration, all the time opens up new spaces.\nThe player can find firearms, Molotov cocktails in bottles and even an indestructible baseball bat. Zombies are of several types: exploding, armored, spitting with acid.\nAmmunition, drugs and other useful things the player finds on the ground. If a player is bitten by a zombie, the player irreversibly turns into a zombie - but everything that he managed to find and collect before, remains the property of this zombie. And in the next game you can find this zombie and take back your possessions. In a multiplayer game, other players can do it.",

    "description": "Pixel Piracy offers the player a role of a pirate captain. The game is designed in a very simplistic pixel-art style. Pixel Piracy plays with all sorts of jokes and comical stereotypes about pirates.\n\n###Setup\nBefore the game starts, the player has to choose the difficulty level and other options by answering questions about the game's world and its main character. Initially, the player only controls a single pirate, the would-be captain. The protagonist is partially customizable: the player can choose the character's look from several presets. As the game begins, the character has to build a ship and recruit a crew before they can set off to the sea. \n\n###Gameplay\nThe goal is to lead your crew to fame by defeating enemy pirates. Other than that, the player is free to explore the map, fight enemies to gain prestige points and upgrade the ship and the crew with new equipment. The pirates belong to various classes. A crew needs fighters to attack enemies, sailors to control the ship, a carpenter to fix it, and a cook to make food. \n\n###Genre\nWhile Pixel Piracy is more of a strategy, there are some features of the roguelike genre. The world is procedurally generated, and the crew will randomly encounter feral beasts and hostile pirates from other gangs. The player has to keep track of the ship's resources, otherwise, the crew might die of starvation or lose its morale. As in the most roguelike games, the death of the main character is permanent, and he will not respawn if killed.",

    "description": "Back to bed is an indie surreal puzzle game developed by Bedtime Digital Games. The game was initially developed as a student project for DADIU. The prototype was later expanded with the help from Kickstarter.\n\nThe player's objective is to help a sleepwalker to safely get to his bed moving the objects in each level. The sleepwalker follows a distinct path. The players have to change this path and guide him in the right direction. The players have to be careful with their decisions as the sleepwalker can just walk off the level. Several entities can also prevent the sleepwalker from arriving at his destination. Most of these entities just block the path and have to be moved out of the way by the player.\n\nThe game features a surreal art style which is somewhat inspired by Pablo Picasso and Salvador Dali. There's also a small mix of the sixties inspired artwork which can be seen in the sleepwalker's outfit or simply the typography of the game.",

    "description": "Skulls of the Shogun is a turn-based tactical strategy game, set in the fantasy of late medieval Japan. The story of the game focuses on the tale of a dead general, once destined to become the new Shogun but viciously interrupted by a stealthy foe. As he meets his demise, man learns that while not exactly he is capable of returning to life, but instead, he can set out on the way to becoming the new Shogun of the Dead.\nThe game features a set of missions, where the player has to control a small army and defeat their enemy, sometimes far outnumbering. Various tactics can be employed to achieve victory, and the clever use of each unit and their abilities often leads to a swift and fruitful conquest. Each map can be replayed, as different outcomes under different circumstances give new bonuses for the further playthrough.\nThe graphics of the game are hand-drawn, styled like a comic book, where every character looks formidable, but at the same time, hilarious. The strange humor of the game includes several gags about the Japanese culture, history, and mythology, and the dialogues between the characters do not leave any player dissatisfied.",

    "description": "This is a free space MMO action game from the Russian studio Targem Games. The player controls spaceships that perform different roles in combat. Each player can develop abilities, and learn special skills, develop new strategies. Under the control of the player, there is a whole fleet of different ships from formidable frigates to small reconnaissance ships. Players can also unite in alliances and fight for control over the galaxy's sectors. The gameplay of similar in many ways to another famous game in the genre E.V.E, Star Conflict is more action and less economic than its competitor, and an understandable control scheme allows the players to perform crazy maneuvers.\n\nPlayers can participate in session based PvP battles or explore the Open Space, where they complete various quests and missions, fight AI controlled enemies and gather resources. With the 'Journey' update developers redesigned the progression system. Players can now earn experience points and unlock new content by taking part in a story-driven campaign.\n\nAccording to the plot of the game, three thousand years passed after the first shuttles with the settlers left the Earth. Now the universe is divided between militarised star empires and scattered groups of mercenaries. In sector 1337, fragments of the mysterious civilization of aliens are found. For ancient artifacts, hunting begins and from all corners of the galaxy fly amateurs of adventure, hunted to profit.",

    "description": "World of Tanks Blitz is a cross-platform action game, aiming at fierce tank combat. \n\n###Gameplay<h3/>\nThe game allows 7v7 battles. The teams are forming randomly, so there can be tanks from different classes (light, medium, heavy and destroyers) and countries (German, UK, USA, and others).\nThe player has to either destroy enemies’ units or capture the neutral base. The base is regarded as taken if your tank stays in a marked zone for a while without getting damaged. The capture proceeds faster as you place more tanks there. Also, there is a superiority mode, which requires the players to win, if they eliminate all foes’ vehicles and gain 1000 win points. Capturing points can earn these points and destroying enemy equipment. There is a possibility to form platoons for two people and to join clans. Many mechanics are taken from the PC-version, for instance, the physics of damage. While moving along the hilly terrain, you can also notice such mechanisms: you can do drift, driving a portable tank on a high-speed. Each map consists of two starting points of the teams. The battlefield itself has many objects and shelters: buildings, bridges, walls, trees.\n\n###Premium features\nThere are two currency systems in the game: credits and gold. You can earn credits from the battles. Both group and individual victories are rewarded. Gold can be purchased for real money, and also received in the course of various actions. Some features of the game become available only if paid in gold.",

    "description": "Cogs is a puzzle video game in which a player has to manipulate a three-dimensional object's sides as sliding block puzzles to complete specific goals, such as meshing gears to complete a clockwork mechanism or routing gas flow through pipes to a balloon.\nEvery level of Cogs represents three-dimensional object, there are various objectives but mostly a player has to move tiles to connect sets of gears, piping and do other manipulative things to make that object behave in ordered way, for example to provide power to turn wheels. All the objects in Cogs are three dimensional, so it needs to be manipulated on different faces which could wrap around the object, or consider sides of tiles. The player has the ability to turn the object in any manner he or she wants to complete the task. \nIn the Cogs, the player mostly has to manipulate various gears, pipes with steam gas which purpose is to drive motors of gears or fill balloons and bell strikers which plays a specific melody if manipulated correctly. There are lots of levels in the game and each of them is more difficult than the previous one, adding more puzzle elements and more objects to manipulate.",

Different species had to unite in order to save Solus from destruction by Varelsi. The best fighters of the world are pronounced Battleborn and are sent to fight.\n\n###Gameplay\nAt the beginning of the game of every game mode featured in the game, the players have to choose one of several characters. Every character features their own abilities, skills, and attacks. A loadout system is also present in the game with players choosing three items to carry into the battle with them. Every item can be bought with an in-game currency named Shards. Such equipment enhances your characters abilities or debuffs your enemies powers. \n\nThe players start at level 1 and gain new experience for leveling up after killing enemies or completing objectives. After leveling up, the player unlocks one perk from the character-specific skill tree. These levels are reset on every new game. There are three main game modes available in the game which put ten players in a match against each other. \n\nPlayers also increase their command level after every gain. In Battleborn's meta-game this allows for unlocking new outfits and cosmetics. New gear can be unlocked using loot drops after each match or picked up during one. The game also features loot boxes.",

Eatable things will also come in handy - from their absorption health is restored, which is very necessary in battles. Useful things meet abundantly, their qualities are diverse, and they have a stable demand - you can sell or change them for something else in the city. The city is present at each of the levels of the game. In the city you can even play on the sweepstakes - to bet on yourself. For example, that you will never be killed, do not suffer damage more than the specified amount, or perform the task strictly up to a certain time. Heroes of the game are skilled in battles - they can even hold several different weapons in the same hand, summing their effects in one stroke. As you progress, the characters gain experience. With experience comes skill. If the experience is not enough, you can always recruit more, having passed any level repeatedly.",

    "description": "HOARD is an arcade action game, set in a fantasy world, where the player will take control of a mighty dragon. The game’s overall main goal is to collect treasure for the dragon’s hoard, as the name implies.\nThe gameplay is based around moving through different landscapes, burning down villages, collecting gold troves and kidnapping members of the local royal family, a classic dragon activity. However, the player needs to defend his character’s lair from daring adventurers. Knights set out on a quest of saving the beautiful princess,  and many more creatures with a common goal of defeating the dragon, which would be you. With level progression, players can upgrade different parameters of their scaled protagonist and improve their gold acquiring capabilities. \nThe game offers four game modes, with cooperative multiplayer gradually increasing the difficulty and the overall fun of each playthrough. The graphics are unique in the way where the game field looks like a board game table, with castles and villages placed around differently each time, and the overall look of the game is as if it was a D&D game that suddenly became alive.",

Its developer is Threaks, indie studios specializing on a single-title IPs. The game's universe includes one more title: Beatbuddy: On Tour, featuring the same world, but different beats and levels. \nThe plot follows no cliffhangers or dramatic turns of events. The story is about trying to save the Music from Maestro Prince, wanting to destroy all beats in the universe. Throughout the game, the player encounters NPC and bosses, all of them needs to be destroyed along with elegant beats. \nThe gameplay includes typical platforming and adventure section — most of the time the players float around the six worlds, with each of them divided into five parts and collects beat parts. One of the exciting features is the unique musical theme to each main character: given the soundtrack composed out of different tunes, it is a remarkable highlight.",

Conrad, a Chief Engineer at a spaceship, facing off troubles of crashing into an enemy ship and the consequent invasion of its inhabitants. The player faces off hordes of aliens throughout the levels of the game, following a story of survival, unknown experiments and the eventual fate of our hero. The game features a vast arsenal of weapons to choose from, each with their pros and cons, and different pickups to help Conrad on his quest.\nAlien Breed 2: Assault includes 2-player cooperative mode, where players can either complete the story together or face off in survival mode, in which they have to stand against endless swarms of enemies. Steam is fully supported for the game, allowing players to compete using leaderboards and challenge each other to beat their scores.",

    "description": "A golfing spin-off in the famous Worms series. Worms Crazy Golf - it's a familiar mix of the main series gameplay and classic golf transforming the latter into turn-based madness. Now the main goal is not to destroy all of the enemy’s worms. The goal is to get into the hole with fewer strikes. The game is a continuation of the mobile-exclusive Worms Golf and adaptation of the format on the PC.\n\nThe player takes control of the worm, which appears on the 2D battlefield. The goal is to drive the ball into the hole. Sometimes on the way, there are explosive sheep that explode to shreds in a collision and other obstacles to overcome. Visually, the game is reminiscent of the game series of the era of 2D Worms 2: Armageddon and Worms Reloaded.\n\nFor a single completion, there are 3x 18 holes courses all with its own visual style and challenges. As well as 15 challenges without complete courses. Also, there is multiplayer available for up to four players on the same device with the alternate right of turn. Worms can be customized to your taste. To do this, you must earn in-game cash to spend it on cosmetic items.",

    "description": "Pid is a puzzle platformer that follows a boy named Kurt who lives in the era of interstellar traveling. Accidentally he missed his planet on the way from school, and got stuck in the place that seemed to have no way out… Now he needs to find out what happens and return home.\nThe gameplay is based on platforming mixed with Kurt’s ability to use so-called beams to pass through levels. These beams create tunnels without gravity that help to come over obstacles, solve puzzles and even fight enemies. More items become available on higher levels. The game only supports co-op on the same console, with no online multiplayer.\nWhile Pid has really hardcore gameplay, its visual style is calm and relaxing. The in-game world is full of secrets and collectibles that balance the gaming experience a little. Almost every NPC has something to tell you, so don't ignore dialogues that will shed some light on Pid's lore.",

    "description": "Star Trek Online is an MMORPG set in a universe shared with the TV Show of the same name. The is a total of 56 video game titles in the Star Trek series which are weakly connected with each other so Online may be considered as a standalone episode. The game is the first MMO in the intellectual property.\n\n###Plot\nThe game follows a storyline of Star Trek: Nemesis is set in 2049 and tells a story of a war between the Klingon Empire and the United Federation of Planets. There is a total of four free add-ons — each of them added fractions, maps, and story arcs, pushing the story forward and connecting it to the 2002 film and the other fragments of the franchise. \n\n###Gameplay\nThe players are taking the role of the spaceship operator. In this role as the captain, they can craft materials useful for the ship construction and modify it in various ways — for example, add modules so it would gain additional features. There is also a time-management feature to this game: not all processes are executed, so the player has to control his resources and account factor carefully to maximize the profits.\nThe game transferred to the free-to-play model shortly after its release. Five years afterward it was remastered already in F2P model.",

    "description": "Table Top Racing: World Tour is a racing simulator with the emphasis on its cartoon-ish style of toy cars. The genre is already well-established, and the game continues to use ordinary mechanics for entertainment and replayability.\nThe player can choose between different upgradeable cars, and compete in four different championships. Each map is a racing track in an utterly non-racing environment, such as a kitchen table, children’s playroom and so on. Different race types make the player consider his car of choice, as well as the upgrades, for the challengers are vicious and always tries to utilize every card in their sleeve against you.\nThe game also features a multiplayer mode, where up to 8 racers can compete with each other on various race tracks, for glory or fun. The soundtrack and the graphics style gives the game the look of a real racing simulator while keeping the setting of toy cars, which allows the players to immerse themselves in the high octane world of Table Top Racing.",

    "description": "Happy Wars is an online multiplayer role-playing strategy; it also features a campaign mode. The game consists of matches: two 15-layers teams try to destroy the opponent’s castle and protect their own.\n\nIn Happy Wars you can choose between three types of characters: the warrior, the mage, and the cleric. They also have subclasses that define their specification. For example, Berserker is stronger than an ordinary warrior and more suitable for protecting lines. In general, every class has their unique abilities that can be upgraded with the in-game currency and real money. Wisely balanced teams have more chances to win battles.\n\nThe key feature that differs Happy Wars from other MOBA-type games is that before you destroy your opponent’s base you need to build yours. Bases are equipped with multiple weapons so it’s hard to get close to the enemy rift. Besides the center, there are several control points; the most massive battles are usually held near them. However, the cartoonish style of the visuals makes such epic fights look funny, explaining the name of the game.",

    "description": "theHunter is a hunter simulation game developed by Expansive Worlds. It is a part of theHunter simulation series and serves as a reboot of the whole series.\n\n###Gameplay\nNo plot whatsoever is present in the game. At the beginning of the game, the players create their own character and complete a tutorial. After that, the players are put into an immersive open world where they can either hunt any animal they find or activate missions, the completion of which grants the players some amount of the in-game currency.\n\nThe game's world is resembled by an immense island that features the surroundings of Washington, United States; Australia; France. The game can be played freely, yet only five species are present in its free-to-play version.\n\nWhile hunting, it is essential for the players to use cover to avoid getting detected by their prey. Each animal has its own specific reaction to the changes in the game's world. Some animals do not sense smells as well as the others, so the players can get to the prey much closer. It is also essential to take the sound you make into account, as it may scare the animal you hunt away.\n\nFor hunting several species, it is required to use a specific weapon. The players are free to use bows on any animal they can find in the world, while the game's firearms' calibers have to be carefully picked out by the players, based on the animal.",

    "description": "Blacklight: Retribution is a multiplayer only game in the cyberpunk setting, a direct sequel to Blacklight: Tango Down. Aside from the tutorial level and matches against bots with human teammates, there is no single player content. Current game modes include not only staples of the genre like Deathmatch and Team Deathmatch, Capture the Flag and King of the Hill, but there is also a twist on the formula in case of Kill Confirmed mode. Players will have to kill enemies, but in order for the kill to count, it’s necessary to collect tokens from them. Teammates can pick up tokens from their friends in order to deny the kill points for the enemy team.\nLater added Onslaught and Siege modes brought more gimmick objective-based gameplay to the game. Total of sixteen maps of different sizes, complexity, and styles, which on top of the fully customizable equipment and appearances allows players to find unique look and playstyle, fitting for them.",

    "description": "Creativerse is a creative sandbox game developed by Playful. The game is distributed completely free of charge and anyone can download it on Steam.\n\n###Gameplay\nThe game's environment is procedurally generated out of blocks. The game takes heavy inspiration from Minecraft and improves upon it concepts.\n\nAt the beginning of the game, the players come into possession of a gauntlet that allows them to manipulate matter. The players create their own character and customize it before being put in a procedurally generated world. The game teaches the players to interact with this world and gives the first tools and tips to do so. \n\nCreativerse improves upon Minecraft's multiplayer modes, as the players do not have to install server-side mods to activate the possibilities of claiming land and the protection of player-created buildings.\n\nThe player progression in Creativerse is made through the recipe system that expands as the players discover more and more crafting recipes. The game's crafting system heavily resembles the same of Minecraft, as the players find resources in the generated world's biomes. These materials are later used to create new items that can also be used to later build more sophisticated tools and weapons. Several very rare recipes can be obtained through combat or dungeon exploration.\n\n###Paid version features\nThe paid version of the game allows creating as many worlds as the players like, grants 20 more inventory slots and new items, such as a flashlight.",

    "description": "###Licensing issues\nPinball Arcade is the meticulous digitization of real analog pinball machines. The licensing was provided to developers from FarSight Studios by Gottlieb, Alvin G. and Company, and Stern Pinball. In addition to a fairly straightforward development process, in parallel developers were negotiating the licensing of gaming tables. As a result, it was possible to negotiate for a certain period, and as of 2018, some types of gaming tables are not available for the game because the license was over. In total, more than sixty tables disappeared, most of which were included in paid DLCs.\n\n###Key features\nThe game came out on all possible platforms: including the most recent ones like Nintendo Switch, Sony PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. On the PC game is available for free, but for new tables, players have to pay. There is no plot in the game, and all the attention of the developers were focused on recreating all the smallest details of the gaming tables and the physics of the ball. The rest is a usual pinball: the player has access to the field and the ball, the main task is to beat out as many points as possible for three attempts, that is, without dropping the ball. You can catch it and toss it again with the help of two sticks that is the only player-controlled object in the entire playing field.",

    "description": "The game is a classic example of arcade racing shoot-em-up with a top-down camera. It tries to mimic Japanese bullet-hell games with a more casual approach. The player takes control of the buggy and joins La Resistance to prevent the Count Soap crimes and the use of stolen water. The buggy can be customized to your taste, using more than 35 upgrades.\n\nLike the plot, the gameplay in Pressure is designed primarily for kids. This is indicated by the casual complexity, an abundance of bright colors and a specific sense of humor. Add here a variety of weapons, upgrades, and enemies; the output will be an excellent timekiller for a couple of evenings. The game features several levels of difficulty, achievements and the ability to go through a story campaign from more than 30 cards together with a friend using the capabilities of a split-screen local coop. All results are published online.",

    "description": "Heroine's Quest: The Herald of Ragnarok is a 2D adventure RPG with a high focus on depicting Norse mythological tradition.\n\n###Gameplay\nThe player follows the path of Heroine through the number of 2D pixel-art locations stylized for 90s games. The RPG element brings classes, skill trees, and looting system into the title. The available classes are warrior, mage, and thief.\nOne of the main focuses is on the realism — the game features a vast variety of deaths, for instance, death from frostbite if the character does not dress well; death from hunger in case the protagonist forgot to eat, and death from poisoning if the hero ate a suspicious flower in a middle of a woods.\nThe battles are not of the primary locus here — nonetheless, the system is simple and concentrated on hitting, casting spells and dodging in the appropriate time. \n\n###Plot\nThe player follows a storyline of a heroine who is destined to prevent Ragnarok — the death of all the living creatures according to the Norse mythology. The Valhalla stories, as well as the Tales of Nine Worlds here, are cleverly mixed-up with the postmodernist gags, forth wall-breaks, and even Harry Potter references. The game's source of inspiration is often confused with Skyrim. However, the developers say, that story resembles Quest for Glory in various ways.",

    "description": "A Virus Named TOM is an indie puzzle strategy game developed by Misfits Attic.\n\nIn a utopic world, a scientist gets fired by a giant corporation. He creates a virus and names it TOM. The only purpose of it is to get revenge. \n\nThe game features 50 single-player levels in 6 different areas. With every completed level, the player disrupts one of the systems of the device that was infected with TOM. Each area represents one device which is used by humans in a utopian world. 50 more are available for cooperative play. The players objective is to connect all the nodes creating connection paths for them while avoiding the anti-virus drones present in the game. Sometimes, the player has to correctly turn the nodes in order to establish a connection. The enemies move in a repetitive pattern of traveling back and forth. While easily avoidable alone, the game gets harder and harder as the number of enemies increases.",

    "description": "APB or All Points Bulletin is an ambitious MMORPG, which anticipated, and perhaps influenced the appearance of GTA Online. The game shares the title with 1987 arcade, but they are not connected whatsoever. At first, the game costed money to play, then it was shut down, and after the restart, it began to use the format of free-to-play. In the spring of 2017, seven years after the original release, the game was released on the PlayStation 4.\n\nThe player is offered to join one of the factions: Enforcers or Criminals. Inside the factions, players can form subgroups for joint missions. The game takes place in the modern city of San Paro, in the streets of which there is constant fighting between the factions. Missions are a task for two opposing teams, using a full arsenal of weapons, a fleet of cars and other vehicles. The character is controlled from a third person perspective, weapons and equipment are bought in terminals, similar to vending machines. The primary goal of the game is to be the strongest man in the neighborhood.",

    "description": "In Starpoint Gemini 2, you assume the role of a starship captain in the distant future. Set in the open world of Gemini system, the game continues the original Starpoint Gemini. The player controls a single vessel that can be used not only for battle but also for many other missions. There are many occupations in the game, and the player can trade, mine resources, explore new planets, enter wars, rescue other ships in distress, hunt for space pirates, or even become a pirate. In the freeroam mode, your missions are randomly generated, while in the campaign mode, there are also scripted quests that form the game’s plot. It offers you a role of a young space cadet who seeks revenge for his dead father. The plot is not binding, however, and the game is more oriented towards free exploration.\nThere’s a roster of more than sixty ships to choose from, and three classes to which your captain character can belong: Gunner, Commander, or Engineer. Each of them has special perks. The ship can be upgraded with new weapons, defenses, and engines. As your influence and wealth grow, you can buy more ships and expand your fleet. You will still only control one ship at a time, while the others may serve as wingmen.",

    "description": "While the Cold War did not turn into a real war, the Earthmen are invited to fight with the Martians - with all the arsenal of the Cold War and several experimental technologies.\n\n###Synthesis of genres\nThe game achieved a productive blending of several genres - the third-person shooter, real-time strategy, and tower defense.\n\nFrom the genre of strategy into the game came the need to build a network of defensive structures capable of resisting the pressure of mechanical invaders. From the genre of the shooter from the third person the game took a powerful action in the entourage of several visual styles - comics of the 50's, neon lights of the 80's and 90's, cold dynamics of the 00's. Much in the design of locations is a quote or allusions to famous works of science fiction of the fifties.\n\n###Instead of the invasion of the Reds, an invasion from the Red Planet\nMars invades the US with its iconic 50s-styled flying saucers, insectoid drones, various robots in the size of a skyscraper, rolling balls that turn into death machines on stilts, floating bombs, iconic 50's-styled flying saucers. The aliens are rolling in waves, from different directions.\n\n###Sci-Fi archetypes\nCharacters that can be played correspond to the chosen style of pulp-sci-fi, including a jetpack piloting heroine, a shotgun wielding space cowboy, a secret government agent, and a battle hardened Marine captain.\n\nYou can play on behalf of one of the characters, but you can also unite with others, and this will give the most guaranteed victory.\n\n###Gameplay\nYou can fight in different ways - attack the aliens, personally shooting them, or building a network of defensive structures. When building, you can use money, sell unnecessary.\n\nYou can alternate the way of action - to run and shoot, and then to build something and so on. Of course, in this situation, there is no time for deep strategic calculations, so the strategic part of the game is not as elaborate as in the games of the strategic genre itself.\n\nThe canon of the genre tower defense is presented in the game much more fully - there are quite useful tools, a great variety of units. For defense with weapons, the player has the soldiers with rocket-propelled grenades, gun turrets, weapons that freeze and fire the enemies and so forth.",

    "description": "Hellion is a first person multiplayer space survival game.\nIt is a fusion of survival and space simulation genres that pits players against the deadly environment and one another. Survive in the harsh conditions of space and scavenge for air, fuel and other items necessary for survival. But keep in mind, you are not the only one out there. There are others, but will they help, or will they throw you to the void without a second thought? Remember, no matter how brutal space may seem, it cannot hold a candle to man.\nHellion is a solar system several thousand lightyears from Earth. Despite its distance, it is the target of the first interstellar colonization mission during the 23rd century. Almost a million colonists, suspended in cryogenic hibernation, leave Sol on a journey that would take many decades.\nHowever, when they wake up, almost a century later, they find themselves trapped inside a nightmare. Instead of living in a manmade paradise, they are forced to fight for survival surrounded by deserted stations, incomplete orbital habitats and derelict warships.\nWith the closest rescue operation decades away, orbital economy in disarray and no authorities in sight, many turn to scavenging, stealing and outright violence. Few others try to live more civilized and begin uncovering the truth behind the largest disaster in human history.\nHellion is an ambitious project. It is an immersive world set in a solar system many lightyears from the comforts of Earth and is entirely based on the laws of Newtonian physics.\nHellion will make its debut as an Early Access game. EA version represents the basics of the vision behind this dark world. As our community grows and the player base expands, the game will evolve beyond these confines and become a true space survival that we can all enjoy. Open and honest communication between developers and community is the cornerstone of this idea. We are always open for discussion with our players as we believe that each and every one of us can add something to this project. Join us in the dystopian future that is Hellion and let’s build this world together!\nBelow is a comprehensive list of features planned for Hellion’s early access.

GameGuru is unsuitable for serious game development projects at this time, and we highly recommend you visit the forums and ask many questions before you make a decision on the game making tool for you.",
